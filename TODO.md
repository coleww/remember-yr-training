ENABLE jumping up through ~some~ things? HOW TO DO THAT?!?!?!?!?




WIZARD TUTORIAL:
point to bed, poems, vend, machine, explain each, how to itneract.





MAYBE: if u don't push the button, u get 1 of the four finale platforms
if u do push the button: u see the city exploding
both lead to a credits?




wtf is going on with the bloodnote?
some weirdness with the inventory menu not clearing? or reloading? loading twice? maybe indialoging? OH
