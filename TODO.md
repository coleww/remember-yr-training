SILO:


ENDINGS:
greed: you collect coins. when u get them all its like ENJOY YR RICHES, THEY ARE WORTHLESS (theres that into to phaser tutorial that should work?)
fight: there are lots of enemies, they are cute, if u touch them they die (just like, random walkers, check for collissions, find cute spritesheets?)
nature: you are in a beautiful forest filled with cat sprites that talk to you

- MAYBE put gifs on the sides and change them? hrmmm. or just tiled metal textures i guess yeah YES DO THIS SO IMPORTANT FOR THE FEELING OF THE SILO TO REALLY ~nail~ THAT ENVIRONMENT AND HAVE PLAYER ~experience~ THE REALITY OF IT ALL
