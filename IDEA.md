['greed', 'nature', 'fight']
// if player overwhelmingly picks one alignment, different ending? ALSO if player fails to escape
3 + 1 + 1
if player gets super faded and turns on the machine early
if player decides to never get out of bed
if player drinks some combo of mushroom and potion, becomes the dragon, destroys bunker, dies in fire (or escapes if that just works?)

8 endings?


thing.useable => use it anywhere, something happens
thing.situational => maybe try somewhere else yo!



user will have +/- from interacting with items
as well as more greed/fight/nature from the vending machine

alignment => type/color of jetpack? ending?
+/- determines whether there are enemies on the way out? how hard it is?





when to show instructions?



VENDING MACHINE ITEMS:
training manual: if the alarm sounds, push the button
scrawled note, covered in blood spatter: dont push the button
????????????????



put a platform/something on top of the bookcase?



COMPUTER: move the blinky stuff more on top of things. align buttons into more panel like stuff
