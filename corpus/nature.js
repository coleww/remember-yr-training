acquisitive tireless and cannot be shaken away8The little one sleeps in its cradle I lift the gauze and look a long time and silently brush away flieswith my hand The youngster and the redfaced girl turn aside up the bushy hill I peeringly view them from the top The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair I note where the pistolhas fallen The blab of the pave tires of carts sluff of bootsoles talk ofthe promenaders The heavy omnibus the driver with his interrogating thumb theclank of the shod horses on the granite floor The snowsleighs clinking shouted jokes pelts of snowballs The hurrahs for popular favorites the fury of rousd mobs The flap of the curtaind litter a sick man inside borne to the hospital The meeting of enemies the sudden oath the blows and fall The excited crowd the policeman with his star quickly working hispassage to the centre of the crowd The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes What

of the country barn stand open and ready The dried grass of the harvesttime loads the slowdrawn wagon The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged The armfuls are packd to the sagging mow I am there I help I came stretchd atop of the load I felt its soft jolts one leg reclined on the other I jump from the crossbeams and seize the clover and timothy And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps10Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night Kindling a fire and

at her prow or shout joyously from the deck The boatmen and clamdiggers arose early and stopt for me I tuckd my trowserends in my boots and went and had a good time You should have been with us that day round the chowderkettle I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far westthe bride was a red girl Her father and his friends sat near crosslegged and dumbly smokingthey had moccasins to their feet and large thick blanketshanging from their shoulders On a bank lounged the trapper he was drest mostly in skins his luxuriantbeard and curls protected his neck he held his bride by the hand She had long eyelashes her head was bare her coarse straight locksdescended upon her voluptuous limbs and reachd to her feet The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile Through the swung halfdoor of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him And brought water and filld a tub for his sweated body and bruisd feet And gave him a room that enterd from my own and gave him somecoarse clean clothes And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and passd north I had him sit next me at table my firelock leand in the corner11Twentyeight young men bathe by the shore Twentyeight young men and all so friendly Twentyeight years of womanly life and all so lonesome She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window Which of the young men does she like the best Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her Where are you off to lady for I see you You splash in the water there yet stay stock still in your room Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twentyninth bather The rest did not see her but she saw them and loved them The beards of the young men glistend with wet it ran from their long hair Little streams passd all over their bodies An unseen hand also passd over their bodies It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs The young men float on their backs their white bellies bulge to thesun they do not ask who seizes fast to them They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch They do not think whom they souse with spray12The butcherboy puts off his killingclothes or sharpens his knifeat the stall in the market I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and breakdown Blacksmiths with grimed

block swagsunderneath on its tiedover chain The negro that drives the long dray of the stoneyard steady andtall he stands poisd on one leg on the stringpiece His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens overhis hipband His glance is calm and commanding he tosses the slouch of his hataway from his forehead The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache falls on the black ofhis polishd and perfect limbs I behold the picturesque giant and love him and I do not stop there I go with the team also In me the caresser of life wherever moving backward as well asforward sluing To niches aside and junior bending not a person or object missing Absorbing all to myself and for this song Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade whatis that you express in your eyes It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life My tread scares the wooddrake and woodduck on my distant anddaylong ramble They rise together they slowly circle around I believe in those wingd purposes And acknowledge red yellow white playing within me And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut yet trills pretty well to me And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me14The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night Yahonk he says and sounds it down to me like an invitation The pert may suppose it meaningless but I listening close Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky The sharphoofd moose of the north the cat on the housesill thechickadee the prairiedog The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats The brood of the turkeyhen and she with her halfspread wings I see in them and myself the same old law The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections They scorn the best I can do to relate them I am enamourd of growing outdoors Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes andmauls and the drivers of horses I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out What is commonest cheapest nearest easiest is Me Me going in for my chances spending for vast returns Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me Not asking the sky to come down to my good

To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow All are written to me and I must get what the writing means I know I am deathless I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenters compass I know I shall not pass like a childs carlacue cut with a burntstick at night I know I am august I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood I see that the elementary laws never apologize I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house byafter all I exist as I am that is enough If no other in the world be aware I sit content And if each and

the Soul The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me The first I graft and increase upon myself the latter I translateinto new tongue I am the poet of the woman the same as the man And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men I chant the chant of dilation or pride We have had ducking and deprecating about enough I show that size is only development Have you outstript the rest are you the President It is a trifle they will more than arrive there every one andstill pass on I am he that walks with the

feeling of me We must have a turn together I undress hurry me out of sight of the land Cushion me soft rock me in billowy drowse Dash me with amorous wet I can repay you Sea of stretchd groundswells Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths Sea of the brine of life and of unshovelld yet alwaysready graves Howler and scooper of storms capricious and dainty sea I am integral with you I too am of

of things in the house and skip the house thatsupports them I am not the poet of goodness only I do not decline to be the poetof wickedness also What blurt is this about virtue and about vice Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me I stand indifferent My gait is no faultfinders or rejecters gait I moisten the roots of all that has grown Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be workd over and rectified I find one side a balance and the antipedal side a balance Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start This minute that comes to me over the past decillions There is no better than it and now What behaved well in the past or behaves well today is not such wonder The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel23Endless unfolding of words of ages And mine a word of the modern the word En Masse A word of the faith that never balks Here or henceforward it is all the same to me I accept Time absolutely It alone is without flaw it alone rounds and completes all That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all I accept Reality

Gentlemen to you the first honors always Your facts are useful and yet they are not my dwelling I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling Less the reminders of properties told my words And more the reminders they of life untold and of freedom and extrication And make short account of neuters and geldings and favor men andwomen fully equipt And beat the gong of revolt and stop with fugitives and them thatplot and conspire24Walt Whitman a kosmos of Manhattan the son Turbulent fleshy sensual eating drinking and breeding No sentimentalist no stander above men and women or apart from them No more modest than immodest Unscrew the locks from the doors Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs Whoever degrades another degrades me And whatever is done or said returns at last to me Through me the afflatus surging and surging through me the currentand index I speak the password primeval I give the sign of democracy By God I will accept nothing which all cannot have theircounterpart of on the same terms Through me many long dumb voices Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves Voices of the diseasd and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion And of the threads that connect the stars and of wombs and of thefatherstuff And of the rights of them the others are down upon Of the deformd trivial flat foolish despised Fog in the air beetles rolling balls of dung Through me forbidden voices Voices of sexes and lusts voices veild and I remove the veil Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigurd I do not press my fingers across my mouth I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart Copulation is no more rank to me than death is I believe in the flesh and the appetites Seeing hearing feeling are miracles and each part and tag of meis a miracle Divine am I inside and out and I make holy whatever I touch or amtouchd from The scent of these armpits aroma finer than prayer This head more than churches bibles and all the creeds If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread ofmy own body or any part of it Translucent mould of me it shall be you Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you Firm masculine colter it shall be you Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you You my rich blood your milky stream pale strippings of my life Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you My brain it shall be your occult convolutions Root of washd sweetflag timorous pondsnipe nest of guardedduplicate eggs it shall be you Mixd tussled hay of head beard brawn it shall be you Trickling sap of maple fibre of manly wheat it shall be you Sun so generous it shall be you Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you Winds whose softtickling genitals rub against me it shall be you Broad muscular fields branches of live oak loving lounger in mywinding paths it shall be you Hands I have taken face I have kissd mortal I have ever touchdit shall be you I dote on myself there is that lot of me and all so luscious Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy I cannot tell how my ankles bend nor whence the cause of my faintest wish Nor the cause of the friendship I emit nor the cause of thefriendship I take again That I walk up my stoop I pause to consider if it really be A morningglory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysicsof books To behold the daybreak The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows The air tastes good to my palate Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently risingfreshly exuding Scooting obliquely high and low Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven The earth by the sky staid with the daily close of their junction The heavd challenge from the east that moment over my head The mocking taunt See then whether you shall be master25Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sunrise would kill me If I could not now and always send sunrise out of me We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds Speech is the twin of my vision it is unequal to measure itself It provokes me forever it says sarcastically Walt you contain enough why dont you let it out then Come now I will not be tantalized you conceive too much ofarticulation Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded Waiting in gloom protected by frost The dirt receding before my prophetical screams I underlying causes to balance them at last My knowledge my live parts it keeping tally with the meaning of all things Happiness which whoever hears me let him or her set out in searchof this day My final merit I refuse you I refuse putting from me what I really am Encompass worlds but never try to encompass me I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you Writing and talk do not prove me I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic26Now I will do nothing but listen To accrue what I hear into this song to let sounds contribute toward it I hear bravuras of birds bustle of growing wheat gossip of flamesclack of sticks cooking my meals I hear the sound I love the sound of the human voice I hear all sounds running together combined fused or following Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city sounds of the day and night Talkative young ones to those that like them the loud laugh ofworkpeople at their meals The angry base of disjointed friendship the faint tones of the sick The judge with hands tight to the desk his pallid lips pronouncinga deathsentence The heaveeyo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves therefrain of the anchorlifters The ring of alarmbells the cry of fire the whirr of swiftstreakingengines and hosecarts with premonitory tinkles and colord lights The steamwhistle the solid roll of the train of approaching cars The slow march playd at the head of the association marching two and two They go to guard some corpse the flagtops are draped with black muslin I hear the violoncello tis the young mans hearts complaint I hear the keyd cornet it glides quickly in through my ears It shakes madsweet pangs through my belly and breast I hear the chorus it is a grand opera Ah this indeed is musicthis suits me A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full I hear the traind soprano what work with hers is this The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possessd them It sails me I dab with bare feet they are lickd by the indolent waves I am cut by bitter and angry hail I lose my breath Steepd amid honeyd morphine my windpipe throttled in fakes of death At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles And that we call Being27To be in any form what is that Round and round we go all of us and ever come back thither If nothing lay more developd the quahaug in its callous shell were enough Mine is no callous shell I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me I merely stir press feel with my fingers and am happy To touch my person to some one elses is about as much as I can stand28Is this then a touch quivering me to a new identity Flames and ether making a rush for my veins Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardlydifferent from myself On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip Behaving licentious toward me taking no denial Depriving me of my best as for a purpose Unbuttoning my clothes holding me by the bare waist Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasturefields Immodestly sliding the fellowsenses away They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me No consideration no regard for my draining strength or my anger Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me The sentries desert every other part of me They have left me helpless to a red marauder They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me I am given up by traitors I talk wildly I have lost my wits I and nobody else am thegreatest traitor I went myself first to the headland my own hands carried me there You villain touch what are you doing my breath is tight in its throat Unclench your floodgates you are too much for me29Blind loving wrestling touch sheathd hooded sharptoothd touch Did it make you ache so leaving me Parting trackd by arriving perpetual payment of perpetual loan Rich showering rain and recompense richer afterward Sprouts take and accumulate stand by the curb prolific and vital Landscapes projected masculine fullsized and golden30All truths wait in all things They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon The insignificant is as big to me as any What is less or more than a touch Logic and sermons never convince The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so Only what nobody denies is so A minute and a drop of me settle my brain I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until itbecomes omnific And until one and all shall delight us and we them31I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey work of the stars And the pismire is equally perfect and a grain of sand and the eggof the wren And the treetoad is a chefdoeuvre for the highest And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery And the cow crunching with depressd head surpasses any statue And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels I find I incorporate gneiss coal longthreaded moss fruitsgrains esculent roots And am stuccod with quadrupeds and birds all over And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons But call any thing back again when I desire it In vain the speeding or shyness In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powderd bones In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods In vain the razorbilld auk sails far north to Labrador I follow quickly I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff32I think I could turn and live with animals they are so placid andselfcontaind I stand and look at them long and long They do not sweat and whine about their condition They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God Not one is dissatisfied not one is demented with the mania ofowning things Not one kneels to another nor to his kind that lived thousands ofyears ago Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth So they show their relations to me and I accept them They bring me tokens of myself they evince them plainly in theirpossession I wonder where they get those tokens Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them Myself moving forward then and now and forever Gathering and showing more always and with velocity Infinite and omnigenous and the like of these among them Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers Picking out here one that I love and now go with him on brotherly terms A gigantic beauty of a stallion fresh and responsive to my caresses Head high in the forehead wide between the ears Limbs glossy and supple tail dusting the ground Eyes full of sparkling wickedness ears finely cut flexibly moving His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him His wellbuilt limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return I but use you a minute then I resign you stallion Why do I need your paces when I myself outgallop them Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you33Space and Time now I see it is true what I guessd at What I guessd when I loafd on the grass What I guessd while I lay alone in my bed And again as I walkd the beach under the paling stars of the morning My ties and ballasts leave me my elbows rest in seagaps I skirt sierras my palms cover continents I am afoot with my vision By the citys quadrangular housesin log huts camping with lumbermen Along the ruts of the turnpike along the dry gulch and rivulet bed Weeding my onionpatch or hosing rows of carrots and parsnipscrossing savannas trailing in forests Prospecting golddigging girdling the trees of a new purchase Scorchd ankledeep by the hot sand hauling my boat down theshallow river Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead where thebuck turns furiously at the hunter Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock where theotter is feeding on fish Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey where thebeaver pats the mud with his paddleshaped tall Over the growing sugar over the yellowflowerd cotton plant overthe rice in its low moist field Over the sharppeakd farm house with its scallopd scum andslender shoots from the gutters Over the western persimmon over the longleavd corn over thedelicate blueflower flax Over the white and brown buckwheat a hummer and buzzer there withthe rest Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze Scaling mountains pulling myself cautiously up holding on by lowscragged limbs Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheatlot Where the bat flies in the Seventhmonth

Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water Where the halfburnd brig is riding on unknown currents Where shells grow to her slimy deck where the dead are corrupting below Where the densestarrd flag is borne at the head of the regiments Approaching Manhattan up by the longstretching island Under Niagara the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance Upon a doorstep upon the horseblock of hard wood outside Upon the racecourse or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game ofbaseball At hefestivals with blackguard gibes ironical licensebulldances drinking laughter At the

puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously Pleasd with the tune of the choir of the whitewashd church Pleasd with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacherimpressd seriously at the campmeeting Looking in at the shopwindows of Broadway the whole forenoonflatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass Wandering the same afternoon with my face turnd up to the cloudsor down a lane or along the beach My right and left arms round the sides of two friends and I in the middle Coming home with the silent and darkcheekd bushboy behind mehe rides at the drape of the day Far from the settlements studying the print of animals feet or themoccasin print By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient Nigh the coffind corpse when all is still examining with a candle Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any Hot toward one I hate ready in my madness to knife him Solitary at midnight in my back yard my thoughts gone from me a long while Walking the old hills of Judaea with the beautiful gentle God by my side Speeding through space speeding through heaven and the stars Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring and thediameter of eighty thousand miles Speeding with taild meteors throwing fireballs like the rest Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly Storming enjoying planning loving cautioning Backing and filling appearing and disappearing I tread day and night such roads I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product And look at quintillions ripend and look at quintillions green I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul My course runs below the soundings of plummets I help myself to material and immaterial No guard can shut me off no law prevent me I anchor my ship for a little while only My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me I go hunting polar furs and the seal leaping chasms with apikepointed staff clinging to topples of brittle and blue I ascend to the foretruck I take my place late at night in the crowsnest We sail the arctic sea it is plenty light enough Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them the scenery isplain in all directions The whitetopt mountains show in the distance I fling out myfancies toward them We are approaching some great battlefield in which we are soon tobe engaged We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment we pass with stillfeet and caution Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruind city The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living citiesof the globe I am a free companion I bivouac by invading watchfires I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips My voice is the wifes voice the screech by the rail of the stairs They fetch my mans body up dripping and drownd I understand the large hearts of heroes The courage of present times and all times How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of thesteamship and Death chasing it up and down the storm How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch and was faithful ofdays and faithful of nights And chalkd in large letters on a board Be of good cheer we willnot desert you How he followd with them and tackd with them three days andwould not give it up How he saved the drifting company at last How the lank loosegownd women lookd when boated from theside of their prepared graves How the silent oldfaced infants and the lifted sick and thesharplippd unshaved men All this I swallow it tastes good I like it well it becomes mine I am the man I sufferd I was there The disdain and calmness of martyrs The mother of old condemnd for a witch burnt with dry wood herchildren gazing on The hounded slave that flags in the race leans by the fenceblowing coverd with sweat The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck the murderousbuckshot and the bullets All these I feel or am I am the hounded slave I wince at the bite of the dogs Hell and despair are upon me crack and again crack the marksmen I clutch the rails of the fence my gore dribs thinnd with theooze of my skin I fall on the weeds and stones The riders spur their unwilling horses haul close Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whipstocks Agonies are one of my changes of garments I do not ask the wounded person how he feels I myself become thewounded person My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe I am the mashd fireman with breastbone broken Tumbling walls buried me in their debris Heat and smoke I inspired I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels They have cleard the beams away they tenderly lift me forth I lie in the night air in my red shirt the pervading hush is for my sake Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy White and beautiful are the faces around me the heads are baredof their firecaps The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches Distant and dead resuscitate They show as the dial or move as the hands of me I am the clock myself I am an old artillerist I tell of my forts bombardment I am there again Again the long roll of the drummers Again the attacking cannon mortars Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive I take part I see and hear the whole The cries curses roar the plaudits for wellaimd shots The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip Workmen searching after damages making indispensable repairs The fall of grenades through the rent roof the fanshaped explosion The whizz of limbs heads stone wood iron high in the air Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general he furiously waveswith his hand He gasps through the clot Mind not memindthe entrenchments34Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth I tell not the fall of Alamo Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelveyoung men Retreating they had formd in a hollow square with their baggage forbreastworks Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemies nine times theirnumber was the price they took in advance Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone They treated for an honorable capitulation receivd writing andseal gave up their arms and marchd back prisoners of war They were the glory of the race of rangers Matchless with horse rifle song supper courtship Large turbulent generous handsome proud and affectionate Bearded sunburnt drest in the free costume of hunters Not a single one over thirty years of age The second Firstday morning they were brought out in squads andmassacred it was beautiful early summer The work commenced about five oclock and was over by eight None obeyd the command to kneel Some made a mad and helpless rush some stood stark and straight A few fell at once shot in the temple or heart the living and deadlay together The maimd and mangled dug in the dirt the newcomers saw them there Some halfkilld attempted to crawl away These were despatchd with bayonets or batterd with the blunts of muskets A youth not seventeen years old seizd his assassin till two morecame to release him The three were all torn and coverd with the boys blood At eleven oclock began the burning of the bodies That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men35Would you hear of an oldtime seafight Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars List to the yarn as my grandmothers father the sailor told it to me Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you said he His was the surly English pluck and there is no tougher or truerand never was and never will be Along the lowerd eve he came horribly raking us We closed with him the yards entangled the cannon touchd My captain lashd fast with his own hands We had receivd some eighteen pound shots under the water On our lowergundeck two large pieces had burst at the first firekilling all around and blowing up overhead Fighting at sundown fighting at dark Ten oclock at night the full moon well up our leaks on the gainand five feet of water reported The masteratarms loosing the prisoners confined in the afterholdto give them a chance for themselves The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust Our frigate takes fire The other asks if we demand quarter If our colors are struck and the fighting done Now I laugh content for I hear the voice of my little captain We have not struck he composedly cries we have just begun our partof the fighting Only three guns are in use One is directed by the captain himself against the enemys mainmast Two well servd with grape and canister silence his musketry andclear his decks The tops alone second the fire of this little battery especiallythe maintop They hold out bravely during the whole of the action Not a moments cease The leaks gain fast on the pumps the fire eats toward the powdermagazine One of the pumps has been shot away it is generally thought we are sinking Serene stands the little captain He is not hurried his voice is neither high nor low His eyes give more light to us than our battlelanterns Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us36Stretchd and still lies the midnight Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking preparations to pass to theone we have conquerd The captain on the quarterdeck coldly giving his orders through acountenance white as a sheet Near by the corpse of the child that servd in the cabin The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefullycurld whiskers The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves dabs of fleshupon the masts and spars Cut of cordage dangle of rigging slight shock of the soothe of waves Black and impassive guns litter of powderparcels strong scent A few large stars overhead silent and mournful shining Delicate sniffs of seabreeze smells of sedgy grass and fields bythe shore deathmessages given in charge to survivors The hiss of the surgeons knife the gnawing teeth of his saw Wheeze cluck swash of falling blood short wild scream and longdull tapering groan These so these irretrievable37You laggards there on guard look to your arms In at the conquerd doors they crowd I am possessd Embody all presences outlawd or suffering See myself in prison shaped like another man And feel the dull unintermitted pain For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch It is I let out in the morning and barrd at night Not a mutineer walks handcuffd to jail but I am handcuffd to himand walk by his side I am less the jolly one there and more the silent one with sweaton my twitching lips Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too and am triedand sentenced Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp My face is ashcolord my sinews gnarl away from me people retreat Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them I project my hat sit shamefaced and beg38Enough enough enough Somehow I have been stunnd Stand back Give me a little time beyond my cuffd head slumbers dreams gaping I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake That I could forget the mockers and insults That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of thebludgeons and hammers That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion andbloody crowning I remember now I resume the overstaid fraction The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it or to any graves Corpses rise gashes heal fastenings roll from me I troop forth replenishd with supreme power one of an averageunending procession Inland and seacoast we go and pass all boundary lines Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years Eleves I salute you come forward Continue your annotations continue your questionings39The friendly and flowing savage who is he Is he waiting for civilization or past it and mastering it Is he some Southwesterner raisd outdoors is he Kanadian Is he from the Mississippi country Iowa Oregon California The mountains prairielife bushlife or sailor from the sea Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him They desire he should like them touch them speak to them stay with them Behavior lawless as snowflakes words simple as grass uncombdhead laughter and naivete Slowstepping feet common features common modes and emanations They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath they fly out ofthe glance of his eyes40Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your basklie over You light surfaces only I force surfaces and depths also Earth you seem to look for something at my hands Say old topknot what do you want Man or woman I might tell how I like you but cannot And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you but cannot And might tell that pining I have that pulse of my nights and days Behold I do not give lectures or a little charity When I give I give myself You there impotent loose in the knees Open your scarfd chops till I blow grit within you Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets I am not to be denied I compel I have stores plenty and to spare And any thing I have I bestow I do not ask who you are that is not important to me You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you To cottonfield drudge or cleaner of privies I lean On his right cheek I put the family kiss And in my soul I swear I never will deny him On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics To any one dying thither I speed and twist the knob of the door Turn the bedclothes toward the foot of the bed Let the physician and the priest go home I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will O despairer here is my neck By God you shall not go down hang your whole weight upon me I dilate you with tremendous breath I buoy you up Every room of the house do I fill with an armd force Lovers of me bafflers of graves Sleep I and they keep guard all night Not doubt not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you I have embraced you and henceforth possess you to myself And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so41I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help I heard what was said of the universe Heard it and heard it of several thousand years It is middling well as far as it goesbut is that all Magnifying and applying come IOutbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah Lithographing Kronos Zeus his son and Hercules his grandson Buying drafts of Osiris Isis Belus Brahma Buddha In my portfolio placing Manito loose Allah on a leaf the crucifixengraved With Odin and the hideousfaced Mexitli and every idol and image Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days They bore mites as for unfledgd birds who have now to rise and flyand sing for themselves Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myselfbestowing them freely on each man and woman I see Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house Putting higher claims for him there with his rolldup sleevesdriving the mallet and chisel Not objecting to special revelations considering a curl of smoke ora hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation Lads ahold of fireengines and hookandladder ropes no less to methan the gods of the antique wars Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction Their brawny limbs passing safe over charrd laths their whiteforeheads whole and unhurt out of the flames By the mechanics wife with her babe at her nipple interceding forevery person born Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angelswith shirts baggd out at their waists The snagtoothd hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come Selling all he possesses traveling on foot to fee lawyers for hisbrother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me andnot filling the square rod then The bull and the bug never worshippd half enough Dung and dirt more admirable than was dreamd The supernatural of no account myself waiting my time to be one ofthe supremes The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as thebest and be as prodigious By my lifelumps becoming already a creator Putting myself here and now to the ambushd womb of the shadows42A call in the midst of the crowd My own voice orotund sweeping and final Come my children Come my boys and girls my women household and intimates Now the performer launches his nerve he has passd his prelude onthe reeds within Easily written loosefingerd chords I feel the thrum of yourclimax and close My head slues round on my neck Music rolls but not from the organ Folks are around me but they are no household of mine Ever the hard unsunk ground Ever the eaters and drinkers ever the upward and downward sun everthe air and the ceaseless tides Ever myself and my neighbors refreshing wicked real Ever the old inexplicable query ever that thornd thumb thatbreath of itches and thirsts Ever the vexers hoot hoot till we find where the sly one hidesand bring him forth Ever love ever the sobbing liquid of life Ever the bandage under the chin ever the trestles of death Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning Tickets buying taking selling but in to the feast never once going Many sweating ploughing thrashing and then the chaff for paymentreceiving A few idly owning and they the wheat continually claiming This is the city and I am one of the citizens Whatever interests the rest interests me politics wars marketsnewspapers schools The mayor and councils banks tariffs steamships factoriesstocks stores real estate and personal estate The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and taild coats I am aware who they are they are positively not worms or fleas I acknowledge the duplicates of myself the weakest and shallowestis deathless with me What I do and say the same waits for them Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them I know perfectly well my own egotism Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less And would fetch you whoever you are flush with

fathomless human brain And what is reason and what is love and what is life43I do not despise you priests all time the world over My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years Waiting responses from oracles honoring the gods saluting the sun Making a fetich of the first rock or stump powowing with sticks inthe circle of obis Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession rapt andaustere in the woods a gymnosophist Drinking mead from the skullcap to Shastas and Vedas admirantminding the Koran Walking the teokallis spotted with gore from the stone and knifebeating the serpentskin drum Accepting the Gospels accepting him that was crucified knowingassuredly that he is divine To the mass kneeling or the puritans prayer rising or sittingpatiently in a pew Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis or waiting deadlike tillmy spirit arouses me Looking forth on pavement and land or outside of pavement and land Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk likeman leaving charges before a journey Downhearted doubters dull and excluded Frivolous sullen moping angry affected disheartend atheistical I know every one of you I know the sea of torment doubt despairand unbelief How the flukes splash How they contort rapid as lightning with spasms and spouts of blood Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers I take my place among you as much as among any The past is the push of you me all precisely the same And what is yet untried and afterward is for you me all preciselythe same I do not know what is untried and afterward But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient and cannot fail Each who passes is considerd each who stops is considerd notsingle one can it fall It cannot fall the young man who died and was buried Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side Nor the little child that peepd in at the door and then drew backand was never seen again Nor the old man who has lived without purpose and feels it withbitterness worse than gall Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder Nor the numberless slaughterd and wreckd nor the brutish koboocalld the ordure of humanity Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in Nor any thing in the earth or down in the oldest graves of the earth Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres nor the myriads of myriadsthat inhabit them Nor the present nor the least wisp that is known44It is time to explain myselflet us stand up What is known I strip away I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown The clock indicates the momentbut what does eternity indicate We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers There are trillions ahead and trillions ahead of them Births have brought us richness and variety And other births will bring us richness and variety I do not call one greater and one smaller That which fills its period and place is equal to any Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you my brother my sister I am sorry for you they are not murderous or jealous upon me All has been gentle with me I keep no account with lamentation What have I to do with lamentation I am an acme of things accomplishd and I an encloser of things to be My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs On every step bunches of ages and larger bunches between the steps All below duly traveld and still I mount and mount Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me Afar down I see the huge first Nothing I know I was even there I waited unseen and always and slept through the lethargic mist And took my time and took no hurt from the fetid carbon Long I was huggd closelong and long Immense have been the preparations for me Faithful and friendly the arms that have helpd me Cycles ferried my cradle rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings They sent influences to look after what was to hold me Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me My embryo has never been torpid nothing could overlay it For it the nebula cohered to an orb The long slow strata piled to rest it on Vast vegetables gave it sustenance Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited itwith care All forces have been steadily employd to complete and delight me Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul45O span of youth everpushd elasticity O manhood balanced florid and full My lovers suffocate me Crowding my lips thick in the pores of my skin Jostling me through streets and public halls coming naked to me at night Crying by day Ahoy from the rocks of the river swinging andchirping over my head Calling my name from flowerbeds vines tangled underbrush Lighting on every moment of my life Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine Old age superbly rising O welcome ineffable grace of dying days Every condition promulges not only itself it promulges what growsafter and out of itself And the dark hush promulges as much as any I open my scuttle at night and see the farsprinkled systems And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim ofthe farther systems Wider and wider they spread expanding always expanding Outward and outward and forever outward My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit And greater sets follow making specks of the greatest inside them There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage If I you and the worlds and all beneath or upon their surfaceswere this moment reduced back to a pallid float it wouldnot avail the long run We should surely bring up again where we now stand And surely go as much farther and then farther and farther A few quadrillions of eras a few octillions of cubic leagues donot hazard the span or make it impatient They are but parts any thing is but a part See ever so far there is limitless space outside of that Count ever so much there is limitless time around that My rendezvous is appointed it is certain The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms The great Camerado the lover true for whom I pine will be there46I know I have the best of time and space and was never measured andnever will be measured I tramp a perpetual journey come listen all My signs are a rainproof coat good shoes and a staff cut from the woods No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair I have no chair no church no philosophy I lead no man to a dinnertable library exchange But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll My left hand hooking you round the waist My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road Not I not any one else can travel that road for you You must travel it for yourself It is not far it is within reach Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land Shoulder your duds dear son and I will mine and let us hasten forth Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go If you tire give me both burdens and rest the chuff of your handon my hip And in due time you shall repay the same service to me For after we start we never lie by again This day before dawn I ascended a hill and lookd at the crowded heaven And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbsand the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them shall webe filld and satisfied then And my spirit said No we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond You are also asking me questions and I hear you I answer that I cannot answer you must find out for yourself Sit a while dear son Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes I kiss youwith a goodby kiss and open the gate for your egress hence Long enough have you dreamd contemptible dreams Now I wash the gum from your eyes You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of everymoment of your life Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore Now I will you to be a bold swimmer To jump off in the midst of the sea rise again nod to me shoutand laughingly dash with your hair47I am the teacher of athletes He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher The boy I love the same becomes a man not through derived powerbut in his own right Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear Fond of his sweetheart relishing well his steak Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts Firstrate to ride to fight to hit the bulls eye to sail askiff to sing a song or play on the banjo Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with smallpox overall latherers And those welltannd to those that keep out of the sun I teach straying from me yet who can stray from me I follow you whoever you are from the present hour My words itch at your ears till you understand them I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat It is you talking just as much as myself I act as the tongue of you Tied in your mouth in mine it begins to be loosend I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house And I swear I will never translate myself at all only to him or herwho privately stays with me in the open air If you would understand me go to the heights or watershore The nearest gnat is an explanation and a drop or motion of waves key The maul the oar the handsaw second my words No shutterd room or school can commune with me But roughs and little children better than they The young mechanic is closest to me he knows me well The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me withhim all day The farmboy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice In vessels that sail my words sail I go with fishermen and seamenand love them The soldier campd or upon the march is mine On the night ere the pending battle many seek me and I do not fail them On that solemn night it may be their last those that know me seek me My face rubs to the hunters face when he lies down alone in his blanket The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon The young mother and old mother comprehend me The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are They and all would resume what I have told them48I have said that the soul is not more than the body And I have said that the body is not more than the soul And nothing not God is greater to one than ones self is And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his ownfuneral drest in his shroud And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds thelearning of all times And there is no trade or employment but the young man following itmay become a hero And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheeld universe And I say to any man or woman Let your soul stand cool and composedbefore a million universes And I say to mankind Be not curious about God For I who am curious about each am not curious about God No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God andabout death I hear and behold God in every object yet understand God not in the least Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself Why should I wish to see God better than this day I see something of God each hour of the twentyfour and each moment then In the faces of men and women I see God and in my own face in the glass I find letters from God dropt in the street and every one is signdby Gods name And I leave them where they are for I know that wheresoeer I go Others will punctually come for ever and ever49And as to you Death and you bitter hug of mortality it is idle totry to alarm me To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes I see the elderhand pressing receiving supporting I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors And mark the outlet and mark the relief and escape And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure but that does notoffend me I smell the white roses sweetscented and growing I reach to the leafy lips I reach to the polishd breasts of melons And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven O suns O grass of graves O perpetual transfers and promotions If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight Toss sparkles of day and dusktoss on the black stems that decayin the muck Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs I ascend from the moon I ascend from the night I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small50There is that in me I do not know what it isbut I know it is in me Wrenchd and sweatycalm and cool then my body becomes I sleep I sleep long I do not know itit is without nameit is a word unsaid It is not in any dictionary utterance symbol Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me Perhaps I might tell more Outlines I plead for my brothers and sisters Do you see O my brothers and sisters It is not chaos or deathit is form union planit is eternallifeit is Happiness51The past and present wilt I have filld them emptied them And proceed to fill my next fold of the future Listener up there what have you to confide to me Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening Talk honestly no one else hears you and I stay only a minute longer Do I contradict myself Very well then I contradict myself I am large I contain multitudes I concentrate toward them that are nigh I wait on the doorslab Who has done his days work who will soonest be through with his supper Who wishes to walk with me Will you speak before I am gone will you prove already too late52The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me he complains of my gaband my loitering I too am not a bit tamed I too am untranslatable I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world The last scud of day holds back for me It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadowd wilds It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk I depart as air I shake my white locks at the runaway sun I effuse my flesh in eddies and drift it in lacy jags I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love If you want me again look for me under your bootsoles You will hardly know who I am or what I mean But I shall be good health to you nevertheless And filter and fibre your blood Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged Missing me one place search another I stop somewhere waiting for you BOOK IV CHILDREN OF ADAMTo the Garden the World To the garden the world anew ascending Potent mates daughters sons preluding The love the life of their bodies meaning and being Curious here behold my resurrection after slumber The revolving cycles in their wide sweep having brought me again Amorous mature all beautiful to me all wondrous My limbs and the quivering fire that ever plays through them forreasons most wondrous Existing I peer and penetrate still Content with the present content with the past By my side or back of me Eve following Or in front and I following her just the same

The general commanding me commanding all from him permission taking From time the programme hastening I have loiterd too long as it is From sex from the warp and from the woof From privacy from frequent repinings alone From plenty of persons near and yet the right person not near From the soft sliding of hands over me and thrusting of fingersthrough my hair and beard From the long sustaind kiss upon the mouth or bosom From the close pressure that makes me or any man drunk faintingwith excess From what the divine husband knows from the work of fatherhood From exultation victory and relief from the bedfellows embrace inthe night From the actpoems of eyes hands hips and bosoms From the cling of the trembling arm From the bending curve and the clinch From side by side the pliant

cannot carry us diverse forever Be not impatienta little spaceknow you I salute the air theocean and the land Every day at sundown for your dear sake my love Ages and Ages Returning at Intervals Ages and ages returning at intervals Undestroyd wandering immortal Lusty phallic with the potent original loins perfectly sweet I chanter of Adamic songs Through the new garden the West the great cities calling Deliriate thus prelude what is generated offering these offering myself Bathing myself bathing my songs in Sex Offspring of my loins We Two How Long We Were Foold We two how long we were foold Now transmuted we swiftly escape as Nature escapes We are Nature long have we been absent but now we return We become plants trunks foliage roots bark We are bedded in the ground we are rocks We are oaks we grow in the openings side by side We browse we are two among the wild herds spontaneous as any We are two fishes swimming in the sea together We are what locust blossoms are we drop scent around lanes morningsand evenings We are also the coarse smut of beasts vegetables minerals We are two predatory hawks we soar above and look down We are two resplendent suns we it is who balance ourselves orbicand stellar we are as two comets We prowl fangd and fourfooted in the woods we spring on prey We are two clouds forenoons and afternoons driving overhead We are seas mingling we are two of those cheerful waves rollingover each other and interwetting each other We are what the atmosphere is transparent receptive pervious impervious We are snow rain cold darkness we are each product and influenceof the globe We have circled and circled till we have arrived home again we two We have voided all but freedom and all but our own joy O Hymen O Hymenee O hymen O hymenee why do you tantalize me thus O why sting me for a swift moment only Why can you not continue O why do you now cease Is it because if you continued beyond the swift moment you wouldsoon certainly kill me I Am He That Aches with Love I am he that aches with amorous love Does the earth gravitate does not all matter aching attract all matter So the body of me to all I meet or know Native Moments Native momentswhen you come upon meah you are here now Give me now libidinous joys only Give me the drench of my passions give me life coarse and rank Today I go consort with Natures darlings tonight too I am for those who believe in loose delights I share the midnightorgies of young men I dance with the dancers and drink with the drinkers The echoes ring with our indecent calls I pick out some low personfor my dearest friend He shall be lawless rude illiterate he shall be one condemnd byothers for deeds done I will play a part no longer why should I exile myself from my companions O you shunnd persons I at least do not shun you I come forthwith in your midst I will be your poet I will be more to you than to any of the rest Once I Passd Through a Populous City Once I passd through a populous city imprinting my brain for futureuse with its shows architecture customs traditions Yet now of all that city I remember only a woman I casually metthere who detaind me for love of me Day by day and night by night we were togetherall else has longbeen forgotten by me I remember I say only that woman who passionately clung to me Again we wander we love we separate again Again she holds me by the hand I must not go I see her close beside me with silent lips sad and tremulous I Heard You Solemn Sweet Pipes of the Organ I heard you solemnsweet pipes of the organ as last Sunday morn Ipassd the church Winds of autumn as I walkd the woods at dusk I heard your longstretchd sighs up above so mournful I heard the perfect Italian tenor singing at the opera I heard thesoprano in the midst of the quartet singing Heart of my love you too I heard murmuring low through one of thewrists around my head Heard the pulse of you when all was still ringing little bells lastnight under my ear Facing West from Californias Shores Facing west from Californias shores Inquiring tireless seeking what is yet unfound I a child very old over waves towards the house of maternitythe land of migrations look afar Look off the shores of my Western sea the circle almost circled For starting westward from Hindustan from the vales of Kashmere From Asia from the north from the God the sage and the hero From the south from the flowery peninsulas and the spice islands Long having wanderd since round the earth having wanderd Now I face home again very pleasd and joyous But where is what I started for so long ago And why is it yet unfound As Adam Early in the Morning As Adam early in the morning Walking forth from the bower refreshd with sleep Behold me where I pass hear my voice approach Touch me touch the palm of your hand to my body as I pass Be not afraid of my body BOOK V CALAMUSIn Paths Untrodden In paths untrodden In the growth by margins of pondwaters Escaped from the life that exhibits itself From all the standards hitherto publishd from the pleasuresprofits conformities Which too long I was offering to feed my soul Clear to me now standards not yet publishd clear to me that my soul That the soul of the man I speak for rejoices in comrades Here by myself away from the clank of the world Tallying and talkd to here by tongues aromatic No longer abashd for in this secluded spot I can respond as Iwould not dare elsewhere Strong upon me the life that does not exhibit itself yet containsall the rest Resolvd to sing no songs today but those of manly attachment Projecting them along that substantial life Bequeathing hence types of athletic love Afternoon this delicious Ninthmonth in my fortyfirst year I proceed for all who are or have been young men To tell the secret my nights and days To celebrate the need of comrades Scented Herbage of My Breast Scented herbage of my breast Leaves from you I glean I write to be perused best afterwards Tombleaves bodyleaves growing up above me above death Perennial roots tall leaves O the winter shall not freeze youdelicate leaves Every year shall you bloom again out from where you retired youshall emerge again O I do not know whether many passing by will discover you or inhaleyour faint odor but I believe a few will O slender leaves O blossoms of my blood I permit you to tell inyour own way of the heart that is under you O I do not know what you mean there underneath yourselves you arenot happiness You are often more bitter than I can bear you burn and sting me Yet you are beautiful to me you faint tinged roots you make methink of death Death is beautiful from you what indeed is finally beautifulexcept death and love O I think it is not for life I am chanting here my chant of lovers I think it must be for death For how calm how solemn it grows to ascend to the atmosphere of lovers Death or life I am then indifferent my soul declines to prefer I am not sure but the high soul of lovers welcomes death most Indeed O death I think now these leaves mean precisely the same asyou mean Grow up taller sweet leaves that I may see grow up out of my breast Spring away from the conceald heart there Do not fold yourself so in your pinktinged roots timid leaves Do not remain down there so ashamed herbage of my breast Come I am determind to unbare this broad breast of mine I havelong enough stifled and choked Emblematic and capricious blades I leave you now you serve me not I will say what I have to say by itself I will sound myself and comrades only I will never again utter acall only their call I will raise with it immortal reverberations through the States I will give an example to lovers to take permanent shape and willthrough the States Through me shall the words be said to make death exhilarating Give me your tone therefore O death that I may accord with it Give me yourself for I see that you belong to me now above all andare folded inseparably together you love and death are Nor will I allow you to balk me any more with what I was calling life For now it is conveyd to me that you are the purports essential That you hide in these shifting forms of life for reasons and thatthey are mainly for you That you beyond them come forth to remain the real reality That behind the mask of materials you patiently wait no matter how long That you will one day perhaps take control of all That you will perhaps dissipate this entire show of appearance That maybe you are what it is all for but it does not last so very long But you will last very long Whoever You Are Holding Me Now in Hand Whoever you are holding me now in hand Without one thing all will be useless I give you fair warning before you attempt me further I am not what you supposed but far different Who is he that would become my follower Who would sign himself a candidate for my affections The way is suspicious the result uncertain perhaps destructive You would have to give up all else I alone would expect to be yoursole and exclusive standard Your novitiate would even then be long and exhausting The whole past theory of your life and all conformity to the livesaround you would have to be abandond Therefore release me now before troubling yourself any further letgo your hand from my shoulders Put me down and depart on your way Or else by stealth in some wood for trial Or back of a rock in the open air For in any roofd room of a house I emerge not nor in company And in libraries I lie as one dumb a gawk or unborn or dead But just possibly with you on a high hill first watching lest anyperson for miles around approach unawares Or possibly with you sailing at sea or on the beach of the sea orsome quiet island Here to put your lips upon mine I permit you With the comrades longdwelling kiss or the new husbands kiss For I am the new husband and I am the comrade Or if you will thrusting me beneath your clothing Where I may feel the throbs of your heart or rest upon your hip Carry me when you go forth over land or sea For thus merely touching you is enough is best And thus touching you would I silently sleep and be carried eternally But these leaves conning you con at peril For these leaves and me you will not understand They will elude you at first and still more afterward I willcertainly elude you Even while you should think you had unquestionably caught me behold Already you see I have escaped from you For it is not for what I have put into it that I have written this book Nor is it by reading it you will acquire it Nor do those know me best who admire me and vauntingly praise me Nor will the candidates for my love unless at most a very fewprove victorious Nor will my poems do good only they will do just as much evilperhaps more For all is useless without that which you may guess at many timesand not hit that which I hinted at Therefore release me and depart on your way For You O Democracy Come I will make the continent indissoluble I will make the most splendid race the sun ever shone upon I will make divine magnetic lands With the love of comrades With the lifelong love of comrades I will plant companionship thick as trees along all the rivers of Americaand along the shores of the great lakes and all over the prairies I will make inseparable cities with their arms about each others necks By the love of comrades By the manly love of comrades For you these from me O Democracy to serve you ma femme For you for you I am trilling these songs These I Singing in Spring These I singing in spring collect for lovers For who but I should understand lovers and all their sorrow and joy And who but I should be the poet of comrades Collecting I traverse the garden the world but soon I pass the gates Now along the pondside now wading in a little fearing not the wet Now by the postandrail fences where the old stones thrown therepickd from the fields have accumulated Wildflowers and vines and weeds come up through the stones andpartly cover them beyond these I pass Far far in the forest or sauntering later in summer before Ithink where I go Solitary smelling the earthy smell stopping now and then in the silence Alone I had thought yet soon a troop gathers around me Some walk by my side and some behind and some embrace my arms or neck They the spirits of dear friends dead or alive thicker they come agreat crowd and I in the middle Collecting dispensing singing there I wander with them Plucking something for tokens tossing toward whoever is near me Here lilac with a branch of pine Here out of my pocket some moss which I pulld off a liveoak in Florida as it hung trailing down Here some pinks and laurel leaves and a handful of sage And here what I now draw from the water wading in the pondside O here I last saw him that tenderly loves me and returns againnever to separate from me And this O this shall henceforth be the token of comrades thiscalamusroot shall Interchange it youths with each other let none render it back And twigs of maple and a bunch of wild orange and chestnut And stems of currants and plumblows and the aromatic cedar These I compassd around by a thick cloud of spirits Wandering point to or touch as I pass or throw them loosely from me Indicating to each one what he shall have giving something to each But what I drew from the water by the pondside that I reserve I will give of it but only to them that love as I myself am capableof loving Not Heaving from My Ribbd Breast Only Not heaving from my ribbd breast only Not in sighs at night in rage dissatisfied with myself Not in those longdrawn illsupprest sighs Not in many an oath and promise broken Not in my wilful and savage souls volition Not in the subtle nourishment of the air Not in this beating and pounding at my temples and wrists Not in the curious systole and diastole within which will one day cease Not in many a hungry wish told to the skies only Not in cries laughter defiancies thrown from me when alone far inthe wilds Not in husky pantings through clinchd teeth Not in sounded and resounded words chattering words echoes dead words Not in the murmurs of my dreams while I sleep Nor the other murmurs of these incredible dreams of every day Nor in the limbs and senses of my body that take you and dismiss youcontinuallynot there Not in any or all of them O adhesiveness O pulse of my life Need I that you exist and show yourself any more than in these songs Of the Terrible Doubt of Appearances Of the terrible doubt of appearances Of the uncertainty after all that we may be deluded That maybe reliance and hope are but speculations after all That maybe identity beyond the grave is a beautiful fable only Maybe the things I perceive the animals plants men hillsshining and flowing waters The skies of day and night colors densities forms maybe theseare as doubtless they are only apparitions and the realsomething has yet to be known How often they dart out of themselves as if to confound me and mock me How often I think neither I know nor any man knows aught of them Maybe seeming to me what they are as doubtless they indeed but seemas from my present point of view and might prove as of course theywould nought of what they appear or nought anyhow from entirelychanged points of view To me these and the like of these are curiously answerd by mylovers my dear friends When he whom I love travels with me or sits a long while holding meby the hand When the subtle air the impalpable the sense that words and reasonhold not surround us and pervade us Then I am charged with untold and untellable wisdom I am silent Irequire nothing further I cannot answer the question of appearances or that of identitybeyond the grave But I walk or sit indifferent I am satisfied He ahold of my hand has completely satisfied me The Base of All Metaphysics And now gentlemen A word I give to remain in your memories and minds As base and finale too for all metaphysics So to the students the old professor At the close of his crowded course Having studied the new and antique the Greek and Germanic systems Kant having studied and stated Fichte and Schelling and Hegel Stated the lore of Plato and Socrates greater than Plato And greater than Socrates sought and stated Christ divine havingstudied long I see reminiscent today those Greek and Germanic systems See the philosophies all Christian churches and tenets see Yet underneath Socrates clearly see and underneath Christ the divine I see The dear love of man for his comrade the attraction of friend to friend Of the wellmarried husband and wife of children and parents Of city for city and land for land Recorders Ages Hence Recorders ages hence Come I will take you down underneath this impassive exterior Iwill tell you what to say of me Publish my name and hang up my picture as that of the tenderest lover The friend the lovers portrait of whom his friend his lover was fondest Who was not proud of his songs but of the measureless ocean of lovewithin him and freely pourd it forth Who often walkd lonesome walks thinking of his dear friends his lovers Who pensive away from one he lovd often lay sleepless anddissatisfied at night Who knew too well the sick sick dread lest the one he lovd mightsecretly be indifferent to him Whose happiest days were far away through fields in woods on hillshe and another wandering hand in hand they twain apart from other men Who oft as he saunterd the streets curvd with his arm the shoulderof his friend while the arm of his friend rested upon him also When I Heard at the Close of the Day When I heard at the close of the day how my name had been receivdwith plaudits in the capitol still it was not a happy night forme that followd And else when I carousd or when my plans were accomplishd still I was not happy But the day when I rose at dawn from the bed of perfect healthrefreshd singing inhaling the ripe breath of autumn When I saw the full moon in the west grow pale and disappear in themorning light When I wanderd alone over the beach and undressing bathedlaughing with the cool waters and saw the sun rise And when I thought how my dear friend my lover was on his waycoming O then I was happy O then each breath tasted sweeter and all that day my foodnourishd me more and the beautiful day passd well And the next came with equal joy and with the next at evening camemy friend And that night while all was still I heard the waters roll slowlycontinually up the shores I heard the hissing rustle of the liquid and sands as directed to mewhispering to congratulate me For the one I love most lay sleeping by me under the same cover inthe cool night In the stillness in the autumn moonbeams his face was inclined toward me And his arm lay lightly around my breastand that night I was happy Are You the New Person Drawn Toward Me Are you the new person drawn toward me To begin with take warning I am surely far different from what you suppose Do you suppose you will find in me your ideal Do you think it so easy to have me become your lover Do you think the friendship of me would be unalloyd satisfaction Do you think I am trusty and faithful Do you see no further than this facade this smooth and tolerantmanner of me Do you suppose yourself advancing on real ground toward a real heroic man Have you no thought O dreamer that it may be all maya illusion Roots and Leaves Themselves Alone Roots and leaves themselves alone are these Scents brought to men and women from the wild woods and pondside Breastsorrel and pinks of love fingers that wind around tighterthan vines Gushes from the throats of birds hid in the foliage of trees as thesun is risen Breezes of land and love set from living shores to you on the livingsea to you O sailors Frostmellowd berries and Thirdmonth twigs offerd fresh to youngpersons wandering out in the fields when the winter breaks up Lovebuds put before you and within you whoever you are Buds to be unfolded on the old terms If you bring the warmth of the sun to them they will open and bringform color perfume to you If you become the aliment and the wet they will become flowersfruits tall branches and trees Not Heat Flames Up and Consumes Not heat flames up and consumes Not seawaves hurry in and out Not the air delicious and dry the air of ripe summer bears lightlyalong white downballs of myriads of seeds Waited sailing gracefully to drop where they may Not these O none of these more than the flames of me consumingburning for his love whom I love O none more than I hurrying in and out Does the tide hurry seeking something and never give up O I the same O nor downballs nor perfumes nor the high rainemitting cloudsare borne through the open air Any more than my soul is borne through the open air Wafted in all directions O love for friendship for you Trickle Drops Trickle drops my blue veins leaving O drops of me trickle slow drops Candid from me falling drip bleeding drops From wounds made to free you whence you were prisond From my face from my forehead and lips From my breast from within where I was conceald press forth reddrops confession drops Stain every page stain every song I sing every word I say bloody drops Let them know your scarlet heat let them glisten Saturate them with yourself all ashamed and wet Glow upon all I have written or shall write bleeding drops Let it all be seen in your light blushing drops City of Orgies City of orgies walks and joys City whom that I have lived and sung in your midst will one day make Not the pageants of you not your shifting tableaus yourspectacles repay me Not the interminable rows of your houses nor the ships at the wharves Nor the processions in the streets nor the bright windows withgoods in them Nor to converse with learnd persons or bear my share in the soireeor feast Not those but as I pass O Manhattan your frequent and swift flashof eyes offering me love Offering response to my ownthese repay me Lovers continual lovers only repay me Behold This Swarthy Face Behold this swarthy face these gray eyes This beard the white wool unclipt upon my neck My brown hands and the silent manner of me without charm Yet comes one a Manhattanese and ever at parting kisses me lightlyon the lips with robust love And I on the crossing of the street or on the ships deck give akiss in return We observe that salute of American comrades land and sea We are those two natural and nonchalant persons I Saw in Louisiana a Live Oak Growing I saw in Louisiana a liveoak growing All alone stood it and the moss hung down from the branches Without any companion it grew there uttering joyous of dark green And its look rude unbending lusty made me think of myself But I wonderd how it could utter joyous leaves standing alone therewithout its friend near for I knew I could not And I broke off a twig with a certain number of leaves upon it andtwined around it a little moss And brought it away and I have placed it in sight in my room It is not needed to remind me as of my own dear friends For I believe lately I think of little else than of them Yet it remains to me a curious token it makes me think of manly love For all that and though the liveoak glistens there in Louisianasolitary in a wide in a wide flat space Uttering joyous leaves all its life without a friend a lover near I know very well I could not To a Stranger Passing stranger you do not know how longingly I look upon you You must be he I was seeking or she I was seeking it comes to meas of a dream I have somewhere surely lived a life of joy with you All is recalld as we flit by each other fluid affectionatechaste matured You grew up with me were a boy with me or a girl with me I ate with you and slept with you your body has become not yoursonly nor left my body mine only You give me the pleasure of your eyes face flesh as we pass youtake of my beard breast hands in return I am not to speak to you I am to think of you when I sit alone orwake at night alone I am to wait I do not doubt I am to meet you again I am to see to it that I do not lose you This Moment Yearning and Thoughtful This moment yearning and thoughtful sitting alone It seems to me there are other men in other lands yearning and thoughtful It seems to me I can look over and behold them in Germany Italy France Spain Or far far away in China or in Russia or talking other dialects And it seems to me if I could know those men I should becomeattached to them as I do to men in my own lands O I know we should be brethren and lovers I know I should be happy with them I Hear It Was Charged Against Me I hear it was charged against me that I sought to destroy institutions But really I am neither for nor against institutions What indeed have I in common with them or what with thedestruction of them Only I will establish in the Mannahatta and in every city of these States inland and seaboard And in the fields and woods and above every keel little or largethat dents the water Without edifices or rules or trustees or any argument The institution of the dear love of comrades The Prairie Grass Dividing The prairiegrass dividing its special odor breathing I demand of it the spiritual corresponding Demand the most copious and close companionship of men Demand the blades to rise of words acts beings Those of the open atmosphere coarse sunlit fresh nutritious Those that go their own gait erect stepping with freedom andcommand leading not following Those with a neverquelld audacity those with sweet and lustyflesh clear of taint Those that look carelessly in the faces of Presidents and governorsas to say Who are you Those of earthborn passion simple never constraind never obedient Those of inland America When I Peruse the Conquerd Fame When I peruse the conquerd fame of heroes and the victories ofmighty generals I do not envy the generals Nor the President in his Presidency nor the rich in his great house But when I hear of the brotherhood of lovers how it was with them How together through life through dangers odium unchanging longand long Through youth and through middle and old age how unfaltering howaffectionate and faithful they were Then I am pensive I hastily walk away filld with the bitterest envy We Two Boys Together Clinging We two boys together clinging One the other never leaving Up and down the roads going North and South excursions making Power enjoying elbows stretching fingers clutching Armd and fearless eating drinking sleeping loving No law less than ourselves owning sailing soldiering thievingthreatening Misers menials priests alarming air breathing water drinking onthe turf or the seabeach dancing Cities wrenching ease scorning statutes mocking feebleness chasing Fulfilling our foray A Promise to California A promise to California Or inland to the great pastoral Plains and on to Puget sound and Oregon Sojourning east a while longer soon I travel toward you to remainto teach robust American love For I know very well that I and robust love belong among youinland and along the Western sea For these States tend inland and toward the Western sea and I will also Here the Frailest Leaves of Me Here the frailest leaves of me and yet my strongest lasting Here I shade and hide my thoughts I myself do not expose them And yet they expose me more than all my other poems No Labor Saving Machine No laborsaving machine Nor discovery have I made Nor will I be able to leave behind me any wealthy bequest to foundhospital or library Nor reminiscence of any deed of courage for America Nor literary success nor intellect nor book for the bookshelf But a few carols vibrating through the air I leave For comrades and lovers A Glimpse A glimpse through an interstice caught Of a crowd of workmen and drivers in a barroom around the stovelate of a winter night and I unremarkd seated in a corner Of a youth who loves me and whom I love silently approaching andseating himself near that he may hold me by the hand A long while amid the noises of coming and going of drinking andoath and smutty jest There we two content happy in being together speaking littleperhaps not a word A Leaf for Hand in Hand A leaf for hand in hand You natural persons old and young You on the Mississippi and on all the branches and bayous ofthe Mississippi You friendly boatmen and mechanics you roughs You twain and all processions moving along the streets I wish to infuse myself among you till I see it common for you towalk hand in hand Earth My Likeness Earth my likeness Though you look so impassive ample and spheric there I now suspect that is not all I now suspect there is something fierce in you eligible to burst forth For an athlete is enamourd of me and I of him But toward him there is something fierce and terrible in me eligibleto burst forth I dare not tell it in words not even in these songs I Dreamd in a Dream I dreamd in a dream I saw a city invincible to the attacks of thewhole of the rest of the earth I dreamd that was the new city of Friends Nothing was greater there than the quality of robust love it led the rest It was seen every hour in the actions of the men of that city And in all their looks and words What Think You I Take My Pen in Hand What think you I take my pen in hand to record The battleship perfectmodeld majestic that I saw pass theoffing today under full sail The splendors of the past day or the splendor of the night thatenvelops me Or the vaunted glory and growth of the great city spread around me no But merely of two simple men I saw today on the pier in the midstof the crowd parting the parting of dear friends The one to remain hung on the others neck and passionately kissd him While the one to depart tightly prest the one to remain in his arms To the East and to the West To the East and to the West To the man of the Seaside State and of Pennsylvania To the Kanadian of the north to the Southerner I love These with perfect trust to depict you as myself the germs are in all men I believe the main purport of these States is to found a superbfriendship exalte previously unknown Because I perceive it waits and has been always waiting latent in all men Sometimes with One I Love Sometimes with one I love I fill myself with rage for fear I effuseunreturnd love But now I think there is no unreturnd love the pay is certain oneway or another I loved a certain person ardently and my love was not returnd Yet out of that I have written these songs To a Western Boy Many things to absorb I teach to help you become eleve of mine Yet if blood like mine circle not in your veins If you be not silently selected by lovers and do not silently select lovers Of what use is it that you seek to become eleve of mine Fast Anchord Eternal O Love Fastanchord eternal O love O woman I love O bride O wife more resistless than I can tell the thought of you Then separate as disembodied or another born Ethereal the last athletic reality my consolation I ascend I float in the regions of your love O man O sharer of my roving life Among the Multitude Among the men and women the multitude I perceive one picking me out by secret and divine signs Acknowledging none else not parent wife husband brother childany nearer than I am Some are baffled but that one is notthat one knows me Ah lover and perfect equal I meant that you should discover me so by faint indirections And I when I meet you mean to discover you by the like in you O You Whom I Often and Silently Come O you whom I often and silently come where you are that I may be with you As I walk by your side or sit near or remain in the same room with you Little you know the subtle electric fire that for your sake isplaying within me That Shadow My Likeness That shadow my likeness that goes to and fro seeking a livelihoodchattering chaffering How often I find myself standing and looking at it where it flits How often I question and doubt whether that is really me But among my lovers and caroling these songs O I never doubt whether that is really me Full of Life Now Full of life now compact visible I forty years old the eightythird year of the States To one a century hence or any number of centuries hence To you yet unborn these seeking you When you read these I that was visible am become invisible Now it is you compact visible realizing my poems seeking me Fancying how happy you were if I could be

contemplating Gently but with undeniable will divesting myself of the holds thatwould hold me I inhale great draughts of space The east and the west are mine and the north and the south are mine I am larger better than I thought I did not know I held so much goodness All seems beautiful to mecan repeat over to men and women You have done such good to me I would do the same to you I will recruit for myself and you as I go I will scatter myself among men and women as I go I will toss a new gladness and roughness among them Whoever denies me it shall not trouble me Whoever accepts me he or she shall be blessed and shall bless me6Now if a thousand perfect men were to appear it would not amaze me Now if a thousand beautiful forms of women appeard it would notastonish me Now I see the secret of the making of the best persons It is to grow in the open air and to eat and sleep with the earth Here a great personal deed has room Such a deed seizes upon the hearts of the whole race of men Its effusion of strength and will overwhelms law and mocks allauthority and all argument against it Here is the test of wisdom Wisdom is not finally tested in schools Wisdom cannot be passd from one having it to another not having it Wisdom is of the soul is not susceptible of proof is its own proof Applies to all stages and objects and qualities and is content Is the certainty of the reality and immortality of things and theexcellence of things Something there is in the float of the sight of things that provokesit out of the soul Now I reexamine philosophies and religions They may prove well in lecturerooms yet not prove at all under thespacious clouds and along the landscape and flowing currents Here is realization Here is a man talliedhe realizes here what he has in him The past the future majesty loveif they are vacant of you youare vacant of them Only the kernel of every object nourishes Where is he who tears off the husks for you and me Where is he that undoes stratagems and envelopes for you and me Here is adhesiveness it is not previously fashiond it is apropos Do you know what it is as you pass to be loved by strangers Do you know the talk of those turning eyeballs7Here is the efflux of the soul The efflux of the soul comes from within through embowerd gatesever provoking questions These yearnings why are they these thoughts in the darkness why are they Why are there men and women that while they are nigh me the sunlightexpands my blood Why when they leave me do my pennants of joy sink flat and lank Why are there trees I never walk under but large and melodiousthoughts descend upon me I think they hang there winter and summer on those trees and alwaysdrop fruit as I pass What is it I interchange so suddenly with strangers What with some driver as I ride on the seat by his side What with some fisherman drawing his seine by the shore as I walk byand pause What gives me to be free to a womans and mans goodwill whatgives them to be free to mine8The efflux of the soul is happiness here is happiness I think it pervades the open air waiting at all times Now it flows unto us we are rightly charged Here rises the fluid and attaching character The fluid and attaching character is the freshness and sweetness ofman and woman The herbs of the morning sprout no fresher and sweeter every dayout of the roots of themselves than it sprouts fresh and sweetcontinually out of itself Toward the fluid and attaching character exudes the sweat of thelove of young and old From it falls distilld the charm that mocks beauty and attainments Toward it heaves the shuddering longing ache of contact9Allons whoever you are come travel with me Traveling with me you find what never tires The earth never tires The earth is rude

"scourses Melesigenes consented and set out with his patron examining all the curiosities of the countries they visited and informing himself of everything by interrogating those whom he met We may also suppose that hepg xii wrote memoirs of all that he deemed worthy of preservation2 Having set sail from Tyrrhenia and Iberia they reached Ithaca Here Melesigenes who had already suffered in his eyes became much worse and Mentes who was about to leave for Leucadia left him to the medical superintendence of a friend of his named Mentor the son of Alcinor Under his hospitable and intelligent host Melesigenes rapidly became acquainted with the legends respecting Ulysses which afterwards formed the subject of the Odyssey The inhabitants of Ithaca assert that it was here that Melesigenes became blind but the Colophomans make their city the seat of that misfortune He then returned to Smyrna where he applied himself to the study of poetry3But poverty soon drove him to Cumae Having passed over the Hermaean plain he arrived at Neon Teichos the New Wall a colony of Cumae Here his misfortunes and poetical talent gained him the friendship of one Tychias an armourer And up to my time continued the author the inhabitants showed the place where he used to sit when giving a recitation of his verses and they greatly honoured the spot Here also a poplar grew which they said had sprung up ever since Melesigenes arrived4But poverty still drove him on and he went by way of Larissa as being the most convenient road Here the Cumans say he composed an epitaph on Gordius king of Phrygia which has however and with greater probability been attributed to Cleobulus of Lindus5Arrived at Cumae he frequented the converzationes6 of the old men and delighted all by the charms of his poetry Encouraged by this favourable reception he declared that if they would allow him a public maintenance he would render their city most gloriously renownedpg xiii They avowed their willingness to support him in the measure he proposed and procured him an audience in the council Having made the speech with the purport of which our author has forgotten to acquaint us he retired and left them to debate respecting the answer to be given to his proposal The greater part of the assembly seemed favourable to the poets demand but one man observed that if they were to feed Homers they would be encumbered with a multitude of useless people From this circumstance says the writer Melesigenes acquired the name of Homer for the Cumans call blind men Homers7 With a love of economy which shows how similar the world has always been in its treatment of literary men the pension was denied and the poet vented his disappointment in a wish that Cumoea might never produce a poet capable of giving it renown and glory At Phocoea Homer was destined to experience another literary distress One Thestorides who aimed at the reputation of poetical genius kept Homer in his own house and allowed him a pittance on condition of the verses of the poet passing in his name Having collected sufficient poetry to be profitable Thestorides like some wouldbeliterary publishers neglected the man whose brains he had sucked and left him At his departure Homer is said to have observed O Thestorides of the many things hidden from the knowledge of man nothing is more unintelligible than the human heart8Homer continued his career of difficulty and distress until some Chian merchants struck by the similarity of the verses they heard him recite acquainted him with the fact that Thestorides was pursuing a profitable livelihood by the recital of the very same poems This at once determined him to set out for Chios No vessel happened then to be setting sail thither but he found one ready to Start for Erythrae a town of Ionia which faces that island and he prevailed upon the seamen to allow him to accompany them Having embarked he invoked a favourable wind and prayed that he might be able to expose the imposture of Thestorides who by his breach of hospitality had drawn down the wrath of Jove the Hospitable At Erythrae Homer fortunately met with a person who had known him in Phocoea by whose assistance he at length after some difficulty reached the little hamlet of Pithys Here he met with an adventure which we will continue in the words of our author Having set out from Pithys Homer went on attracted by the cries of some goats that were pasturing The dogs barked on his approach and he cried out Glaucus for that was the name of the goatherd heard his voice ran up quickly called off his dogs and drove them away from Homer For or some time he stood wondering how a blind man should havepg xiv reached such a place alone and what could be his design in coming He then went up to him and inquired who he was and how he had come to desolate places and untrodden spots and of what he stood in need Homer by recounting to him the whole history of his misfortunes moved him with compassion and he took him and led him to his cot and having lit a fire bade him sup9The dogs instead of eating kept barking at the stranger according to their usual habit Whereupon Homer addressed Glaucus thus O Glaucus my friend prythee attend to my behest First give the dogs their supper at the doors of the hut for so it is better since whilst they watch nor thief nor wild beast will approach the fold Glaucus was pleased with the advice and marvelled at its author Having finished supper they banqueted10 afresh on conversation Homer narrating his wanderings and telling of the cities he had visited At length they retired to rest but on the following morning Glaucus resolved to go to his master and acquaint him with his meeting with Homer Having left the goats in charge of a fellowservant he left Homer at home promising to return quickly Having arrived at Bolissus a place near the farm and finding his mate he told him the whole story respecting Homer and his journey He paid little attention to what he said and blamed Glaucus for his stupidity in taking in and feeding maimed and enfeebled persons However he bade him bring the stranger to him Glaucus told Homer what had taken place and bade him follow him assuring him that good fortune would be the result Conversation soon showed that the stranger was a man of much cleverness and general knowledge and the Chian persuaded him to remain and to undertake the charge of his children11Besides the satisfaction of driving the impostor Thestorides from the island Homer enjoyed considerable success as a teacher In the town of Chios he established a school where he taught the precepts of poetry To this day says Chandler12 the most curious remain is that which has been named without reason the School of Homer It is on the coast at some distance from the city northward and appears to have been an open temple of Cybele formed on the top of a rock The shape is oval and in the centre is the image of the goddess thepg xv head and an arm wanting She is represented as usual sitting The chair has a lion carved on each side and on the back The area is bounded by a low rim or seat and about five yards over The whole is hewn out of the mountain is rude indistinct and probably of the most remote antiquity So successful was this school that Homer realised a considerable fortune He married and had two daughters one of whom died single the other married a Chian The following passage betrays the same tendency to connect the personages of the poems with the history of the poet which has already been mentioned In his poetical compositions Homer displays great gratitude towards Mentor of Ithaca in the Odyssey whose name he has inserted in his poem as the companion of Ulysses13 in return for the care taken of him when afflicted with blindness He also testifies his gratitude to Phemius who had given him both sustenance and instruction His celebrity continued to increase and many persons advised him to visit Greece whither his reputation had now extended Having it is said made some additions to his poems calculated to please the vanity of the Athenians of whose city he had hitherto made no mention14 he sent out for Samos Here being recognized by a Samian who had met with him in Chios he was handsomely received and invited to join in celebrating the Apaturian festival He recited some verses which gave great satisfaction and by singing the Eiresione at the New Moon festivals he earned a subsistence visiting the houses of the rich with whose children he was very popular In the spring he sailed for Athens and arrived at the island of Ios now Ino where he fell extremely ill and died It is said that his death arose from vexation at not having been able to unravel an enigma proposed by some fishermens children15Such is in brief the substance of the earliest life of Homer we possess and so broad are the evidences of its historical worthlessness that it is scarcely necessary to point them out in detail Let us now consider some of the opinions to which a persevering patient and learnedbut by no means consistentseries of investigations has led In doing so I profess to bring forward statements not to vouch for their reasonableness or probability Homer appeared The history of this poet and his works is lost in doubtful obscurity as is the history of many of the first minds who have done honour to humanity because they rose amidst darkness The majestic stream of his song blessing and fertilizing flows like the Nile through many lands and nations and like the sources of the Nile its fountains will ever remain concealedpg xvi",
"Such are the words in which one of the most judicious German critics has eloquently described the uncertainty in which the whole of the Homeric question is involved With no less truth and feeling he proceeds It seems here of chief importance to expect no more than the nature of things makes possible If the period of tradition in history is the region of twilight we should not expect in it perfect light The creations of genius always seem like miracles because they are for the most part created far out of the reach of observation If we were in possession of all the historical testimonies we never could wholly explain the origin of the Iliad and the Odyssey for their origin in all essential points must have remained the secret of the poet 16From this criticism which shows as much insight into the depths of human nature as into the minute wiredrawings of scholastic investigation let us pass on to the main question at issue Was Homer an individual17 or were the Iliad and Odyssey the result of an ingenious arrangement of fragments by earlier poets Well has Landor remarked Some tell us there were twenty Homers some deny that there was ever one It were idle and foolish to shake the contents of a vase in order to let them settle at last We are perpetually labouring to destroy our delights our composure our devotion to superior power Of all the animals on earth we least know what is good for us My opinion is that what is best for us is our admiration of good No man living venerates Homer more than I do 18But greatly as we admire the generous enthusiasm which rests contented with the poetry on which its best impulses had been nurtured and fostered without seeking to destroy the vividness of first impressions by minute analysisour editorial office compels us to give some attention to the doubts and difficulties with which the Homeric question is beset and to entreat our reader for a brief period to prefer his judgment to his imagination and to condescend to dry details Before however entering into particulars respecting the question of this unity of the Homeric poems at least of the Iliad I must express my sympathy with the sentiments expressed in the following remarks We cannot but think the universal admiration of its unity by the better the poetic age of Greece almost conclusive testimony to its original composition It was not till the age of the grammarians that its primitive integrity was called in question nor is it injustice to assert that the minute and analytical spirit of a grammarian is not the best qualification for the profound feeling the comprehensive conception of an harmonious whole The most exquisite anatomist may be no judge of the symmetry of the human frame and we would take the opinion of Chantrey or Westmacott on the proportions and general beauty of a form rather than that of Mr Brodie or Sir Astley Cooperpg xvii",

"Long was the time which elapsed before any one dreamt of questioning the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems The grave and cautious Thucydides quoted without hesitation the Hymn to Apollo20 the authenticity of which has been already disclaimed by modern critics Longinus in an oft quoted passage merely expressed an opinion touching the comparative inferiority of the Odyssey to the Iliad21 and among a mass of ancient authors whose very names22 it would be tedious to detail no suspicion of the personal nonexistence of Homer ever arose So far the voice of antiquity seems to be in favour of our early ideas on the subject let us now see what are the discoveries to which more modern investigations lay claim At the end of the seventeenth century doubts had begun to awaken on the subject and we find Bentley remarking that Homer wrote a sequel of songs and rhapsodies to be sung by himself for small comings and good cheer at festivals and other days of merriment These loose songs were not collected together in the form of an epic poem till about Peisistratus time about five hundred years after23Two French writers Hedelin and Perraultavowed a similar scepticism on the subject but it is in the Scienza Nuova of Battista Vico that we first meet with the germ of the theory subsequently defended by Wolf with so much learning and acuteness Indeed it is with the Wolfian theory that we have chiefly to deal and with the following bold hypothesis which we will detail in the words of Grote24Half a century ago the acute and valuable Prolegomena of F A Wolf turning to account the Venetian Scholia which had then beenpg xviii recently published first opened philosophical discussion as to the history of the Homeric text A considerable part of that dissertation though by no means the whole is employed in vindicating the position previously announced by Bentley amongst others that the separate constituent portions of the Iliad and Odyssey had not been cemented together into any compact body and unchangeable order until the days of Peisistratus in the sixth century before Christ As a step towards that conclusion Wolf maintained that no written copies of either poem could be shown to have existed during the earlier times to which their composition is referred and that without writing neither the perfect symmetry of so complicated a work could have been originally conceived by any poet nor if realized by him transmitted with assurance to posterity The absence of easy and convenient writing such as must be indispensably supposed for long manuscripts among the early Greeks was thus one of the points in Wolfs case against the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey By Nitzsch and other leading opponents of Wolf the connection of the one with the other seems to have been accepted as he originally put it and it has been considered incumbent on those who defended the ancient aggregate character of the Iliad and Odyssey to maintain that they were written poems from the beginning To me it appears that the architectonic functions ascribed by Wolf to Peisistratus and his associates in reference to the Homeric poems are nowise admissible But much would undoubtedly be gained towards that view of the question if it could be shown that in order to controvert it we were driven to the necessity of admitting long written poems in the ninth century before the Christian aera Few things in my opinion can be more improbable and Mr Payne Knight opposed as he is to the Wolfian hypothesis admits this no less than Wolf himself The traces of writing in Greece even in the seventh century before the Christian aera are exceedingly trifling We have no remaining inscription earlier than the fortieth Olympiad and the early inscriptions are rude and unskilfully executed nor can we even assure ourselves whether Archilochus Simonides of Amorgus Kallinus Tyrtaeus Xanthus and the other early elegiac and lyric poets committed their compositions to writing or at what time the practice of doing so became familiar The first positive ground which authorizes us to presume the existence of a manuscript of Homer is in the famous ordinance of Solon with regard to the rhapsodies at the Panathenaea but for what length of time previously manuscripts had existed we are unable to say Those who maintain the Homeric poems to have been written from the beginning rest their case not upon positive proofs nor yet upon the existing habits of society with regard to poetryfor they admit generally that the Iliad and Odyssey were not read but recited and heardbut upon the supposed necessity that there must have been manuscripts to ensure the preservation of the poemsthe unassisted memory of reciters being neither sufficient nor trustworthy But here we only escape a smaller difficulty by running into a greater for the existence of trained bards gifted with extraordinary memorypg xix 25 is far less astonishing than that of long manuscripts in an age essentially nonreading and nonwriting and when even suitable instruments and materials for the process are not obvious Moreover there is a strong positive reason for believing that the bard was under no necessity of refreshing his memory by consulting a manuscript for if such had been the fact blindness would have been a disqualification for the profession which we know that it was not as well from the example of Demodokus in the Odyssey as from that of the blind bard of Chios in the Hymn to the Delian Apollo whom Thucydides as well as the general tenor of Grecian legend identifies with Homer himself The author of that hymn be he who he may could never have described a blind man as attaining the utmost perfection in his art if he had been conscious that the memory of the bard was only maintained by constant reference to the manuscript in his chest The loss of the digamma that crux of critics that quicksand upon which even the acumen of Bentley was shipwrecked seems to prove beyond a doubt that the pronunciation of the Greek language had undergone a considerable change Now it is certainly difficult to suppose that the Homeric poems could have suffered by this change had written copies been preserved If Chaucers poetry for instance had not been written it could only have come down to us in a softened form more like the effeminate version of Dryden than the rough quaint noble original At what period continues Grote these poems or indeed any other Greek poems first began to be written must be matter of conjecture though there is ground for assurance that it was before the time of Solon If in the absence of evidence we may venture uponpg xx naming any more determinate period the question a once suggests itself What were the purposes which in that state of society a manuscript at its first commencement must have been intended to answer For whom was a written Iliad necessary Not for the rhapsodes for with them it was not only planted in the memory but also interwoven with the feelings and conceived in conjunction with all those flexions and intonations of voice pauses and other oral artifices which were required for emphatic delivery and which the naked manuscript could never reproduce Not for the general publicthey were accustomed to receive it with its rhapsodic delivery and with its accompaniments of a solemn and crowded festival The only persons for whom the written Iliad would be suitable would be a select few studious and curious men a class of readers capable of analyzing the complicated emotions which they had experienced as hearers in the crowd and who would on perusing the written words realize in their imaginations a sensible portion of the impression communicated by the reciter Incredible as the statement may seem in an age like the present there is in all early societies and there was in early Greece a time when no such reading class existed If we could discover at what time such a class first began to be formed we should be able to make a guess at the time when the old epic poems were first committed to writing Now the period which may with the greatest probability be fixed upon as having first witnessed the formation even of the narrowest reading class in Greece is the middle of the seventh century before the Christian aera BC 660 to BC 630 the age of Terpander Kallinus Archilochus Simonides of Amorgus c I ground this supposition on the change then operated in the character and tendencies of Grecian poetry and musicthe elegiac and the iambic measures having been introduced as rivals to the primitive hexameter and poetical compositions having been transferred from the epical past to the affairs of present and real life Such a change was important at a time when poetry was the only known mode of publication to use a modern phrase not altogether suitable yet the nearest approaching to the sense It argued a new way of looking at the old epical treasures of the people as well as a thirst for new poetical effect and the men who stood forward in it may well be considered as desirous to study and competent to criticize from their own individual point of view the written words of the Homeric rhapsodies just as we are told that Kallinus both noticed and eulogized the Thebais as the production of Homer There seems therefore ground for conjecturing that for the use of this newlyformed and important but very narrow class manuscripts of the Homeric poems and other old epicsthe Thebais and the Cypria as well as the Iliad and the Odysseybegan to be compiled towards the middle of the seventh century BC 1 and the opening of Egypt to Grecian commerce which took place about the same period would furnish increased facilities for obtaining the requisite papyrus to write upon A reading class when once formed would doubtless slowly increase and the number of manuscripts along with it so that before the time of Solon fifty years afterwards both readers and manuscripts though still comparatively few might have attained apg xxi certain recognized authority and formed a tribunal of reference against the carelessness of individual rhapsodes26But even Peisistratus has not been suffered to remain in possession of the credit and we cannot help feeling the force of the following observations There are several incidental circumstances which in our opinion throw some suspicion over the whole history of the Peisistratid compilation at least over the theory that the Iliad was cast into its present stately and harmonious form by the directions of the Athenian ruler If the great poets who flourished at the bright period of Grecian song of which alas we have inherited little more than the fame and the faint echo if Stesichorus Anacreon and Simonides were employed in the noble task of compiling the Iliad and Odyssey so much must have been done to arrange to connect to harmonize that it is almost incredible that stronger marks of Athenian manufacture should not remain Whatever occasional anomalies may be detected anomalies which no doubt arise out of our own ignorance of the language of the Homeric age however the irregular use of the digamma may have perplexed our Bentleys to whom the name of Helen is said to have caused as much disquiet and distress as the fair one herself among the heroes of her age however Mr Knight may have failed in reducing the Homeric language to its primitive form however finally the Attic dialect may not have assumed all its more marked and distinguishing characteristicsstill it is difficult to suppose that the language particularly in the joinings and transitions and connecting parts should not more clearly betray the incongruity between the more ancient and modern forms of expression It is not quite in character with such a period to imitate an antique style in order to piece out an imperfect poem in the character of the original as Sir Walter Scott has done in his continuation of Sir Tristram If however not even such faint and indistinct traces of Athenian compilation are discoverable in the language of the poems the total absence of Athenian national feeling is perhaps no less worthy of observation In later and it may fairly be suspected in earlier times the Athenians were more than ordinarily jealous of the fame of their ancestors But amid all the traditions of the glories of early Greece embodied in the Iliad the Athenians play a most subordinate and insignificant part Even the few passages which relate to their ancestors Mr Knight suspects to be interpolations It is possible indeed that in its leading outline the Iliad may be true to historic fact that in the great maritime expedition of western Greece against the rival and halfkindred empire of the Laomedontiadae the chieftain of Thessaly from his valour and the number of his forces may have been the most important ally of the Peloponnesian sovereign the preeminent value of the ancient poetry on the Trojan war may thus have forced the national feeling of the Athenians to yield to their taste The songs which spoke of their own great ancestor were no doubt of far inferior sublimity and popularity or at first sight a Theseid would have been much more likely to have emanated from an Athenian synod of compilers ofpg xxii ancient song than an Achilleid or an Olysseid Could France have given birth to a Tasso Tancred would have been the hero of the Jerusalem If however the Homeric ballads as they are sometimes called which related the wrath of Achilles with all its direful consequences were so far superior to the rest of the poetic cycle as to admit no rivalryit is still surprising that throughout the whole poem the callida junctura should never betray the workmanship of an Athenian hand and that the national spirit of a race who have at a later period not inaptly been compared to our self admiring neighbours the French should submit with lofty self denial to the almost total exclusion of their own ancestorsor at least to the questionable dignity of only having produced a leader tolerably skilled in the military tactics of his age27To return to the Wolfian theory While it is to be confessed that Wolfs objections to the primitive integrity of the Iliad and Odyssey have never been wholly got over we cannot help discovering that they have failed to enlighten us as to any substantial point and that the difficulties with which the whole subject is beset are rather augmented than otherwise if we admit his hypothesis Nor is Lachmanns28 modification of his theory any better He divides the first twentytwo books of the Iliad into sixteen different songs and treats as ridiculous the belief that their amalgamation into one regular poem belongs to a period earlier than the age of Peisistratus This as Grote observes explains the gaps and contradictions in the narrative but it explains nothing else Moreover we find no contradictions warranting this belief and the socalled sixteen poets concur in getting rid of the following leading men in the first battle after the secession of Achilles Elphenor chief of the Euboeans Tlepolemus of the Rhodians Pandarus of the Lycians Odius of the Halizonians Pirous and Acamas of the Thracians None of these heroes again make their appearance and we can but agree with Colonel Mure that it seems strange that any number of independent poets should have so harmoniously dispensed with the services of all six in the sequel The discrepancy by which Pylaemenes who is represented as dead in the fifth book weeps at his sons funeral in the thirteenth can only be regarded as the result of an interpolation Grote although not very distinct in stating his own opinions on the subject has done much to clearly show the incongruity of the Wolfian theory and of Lachmanns modifications with the character of Peisistratus But he has also shown and we think with equal success that the two questions relative to the primitive unity of these poems or supposing that impossible the unison of these parts by Peisistratus and not before his time are essentially distinct In short a man may believe the Iliad to have been put together out of preexisting songs without recognising the age of Peisistratus as the period of its first compilation The friends or literary employes of Peisistratus must have found an Iliad that was already ancient and the silence of the Alexandrine critics respecting the Peisistratic recension goes farpg xxiii to prove that among the numerous manuscripts they examined this was either wanting or thought unworthy of attention Moreover he continues the whole tenor of the poems themselves confirms what is here remarked There is nothing either in the Iliad or Odyssey which savours of modernism applying that term to the age of Peisistratusnothing which brings to our view the alterations brought about by two centuries in the Greek language the coined money the habits of writing and reading the despotisms and republican governments the close military array the improved construction of ships the Amphiktyonic convocations the mutual frequentation of religious festivals the Oriental and Egyptian veins of religion c familiar to the latter epoch These alterations Onomakritus and the other literary friends of Peisistratus could hardly have failed to notice even without design had they then for the first time undertaken the task of piecing together many self existent epics into one large aggregate Everything in the two great Homeric poems both in substance and in language belongs to an age two or three centuries earlier than Peisistratus Indeed even the interpolations or those passages which on the best grounds are pronounced to be such betray no trace of the sixth century before Christ and may well have been heard by Archilochus and Kallinusin some cases even by Arktinus and Hesiodas genuine Homeric matter29 As far as the evidences on the case as well internal as external enable us to judge we seem warranted in believing that the Iliad and Odyssey were recited substantially as they now stand always allowing for paitial divergences of text and interpolations in 776 BC our first trustworthy mark of Grecian time and this ancient date let it be added as it is the bestauthenticated fact so it is also the most important attribute of the Homeric poems considered in reference to Grecian history for they thus afford us an insight into the antihistorical character of the Greeks enabling us to trace the subsequent forward march of the nation and to seize instructive contrasts between their former and their later condition30On the whole I am inclined to believe that the labours of Peisistratus were wholly of an editorial character although I must confess that I can lay down nothing respecting the extent of his labours At the same time so far from believing that the composition or primary arrangement of these poems in their present form was the work of Peisistratus I am rather persuaded that the fine taste and elegant mind of that Athenian31 would lead him to preserve an ancient and traditional order of the poems rather than to patch and reconstruct them according to a fanciful hypothesis I will not repeat the many discussions respecting whether the poems were written or not or whether the art of writing was known in the time of their reputed author Suffice it to say that the more we read the less satisfied we are upon either subjectpg xxiv",
"I cannot however help thinking that the story which attributes the preservation of these poems to Lycurgus is little else than a version of the same story as that of Peisistratus while its historical probability must be measured by that of many others relating to the Spartan Confucius I will conclude this sketch of the Homeric theories with an attempt made by an ingenious friend to unite them into something like consistency It is as follows No doubt the common soldiers of that age had like the common sailors of some fifty years ago some one qualified to discourse in excellent music among them Many of these like those of the negroes in the United States were extemporaneous and allusive to events passing around them But what was passing around them The grand events of a spiritstirring war occurrences likely to impress themselves as the mystical legends of former times had done upon their memory besides which a retentive memory was deemed a virtue of the first water and was cultivated accordingly in those ancient times Ballads at first and down to the beginning of the war with Troy were merely recitations with an intonation Then followed a species of recitative probably with an intoned burden Tune next followed as it aided the memory considerably It was at this period about four hundred years after the war that a poet flourished of the name of Melesigenes or Moeonides but most probably the former He saw that these ballads might be made of great utility to his purpose of writing a poem on the social position of Hellas and as a collection he published these lays connecting them by a tale of his own This poem now exists under the title of the Odyssea The author however did not affix his own name to the poem which in fact was great part of it remodelled from the archaic dialect of Crete in which tongue the ballads were found by him He therefore called it the poem of Homeros or the Collector but this is rather a proof of his modesty and talent than of his mere drudging arrangement of other peoples ideas for as Grote has finely observed arguing for the unity of authorship a great poet might have recast preexisting separate songs into one comprehensive whole but no mere arrangers or compilers would be competent to do so While employed on the wild legend of Odysseus he met with a ballad recording the quarrel of Achilles and Agamemnon His noble mind seized the hint that there presented itself and the Achilleis32 grew under his hand Unity of design however caused him to publish the poem under the same pseudonyme as his former work and the disjointed lays of the ancient bards were joined together like those relating to the Cid into a chronicle history named the Iliad Melesigenes knew that the poem was destined to be a lasting one and so it has proved but first the poems were destined to undergo many vicissitudes and corruptions by the people who took to singing them in the streets assemblies and agoras However Solon first and thenpg xxv Peisistratus and afterwards Aristoteles and others revised the poems and restored the works of Melesigenes Homeros to their original integrity in a great measure33Having thus given some general notion of the strange theories which have developed themselves respecting this most interesting subject I must still express my conviction as to the unity of the authorship of the Homeric poems To deny that many corruptions and interpolations disfigure them and that the intrusive hand of the poetasters may here and there have inflicted a wound more serious than the negligence of the copyist would be an absurd and captious assumption but it is to a higher criticism that we must appeal if we would either understand or enjoy these poems In maintaining the authenticity and personality of their one author be he Homer or Melesigenes quocunque nomine vocari eum jus fasque sit I feel conscious that while the whole weight of historical evidence is against the hypothesis which would assign these great works to a plurality of authors the most powerful internal evidence and that which springs from the deepest and most immediate impulse of the soul also speaks eloquently to the contrary The minutiae of verbal criticism I am far from seeking to despise Indeed considering the character of some of my own books such an attempt would be gross inconsistency But while I appreciate its importance in a philological view I am inclined to set little store on its aesthetic value especially in poetry Three parts of the emendations made upon poets are mere alterations some of which had they been suggested to the author by his Maecenas or Africanus he would probably have adopted Moreover those who are most exact in laying down rules of verbal criticism and interpretation are often least competent to carry out their own precepts Grammarians are not poets by profession but may be so per accidens I do not at this moment remember two emendations on Homer calculated to substantially improve the poetry of a passage although a mass of remarks from Herodotus down to Loewe have given us the history of a thousand minute points without which our Greek knowledge would be gloomy and jejune But it is not on words only that grammarians mere grammarians will exercise their elaborate and often tiresome ingenuity Binding down an heroic or dramatic poet to the block upon which they have previously dissected his words and sentences they proceed to use the axe and the pruning knife by wholesale and inconsistent in everything but their wish to make out a case of unlawful affiliation they cut out book after book passage after passage till the author is reduced to a collection of fragments or till those who fancied they possessed the works of some great man find that they have been put off with a vile counterfeit got up at second hand If we compare the theories of Knight Wolf Lachmann and others we shall feel better satisfied of the utter uncertainty of criticism than of the apocryphal position of Homer One rejects what another considers the turningpoint of hispg xxvi theory One cuts a supposed knot by expunging what another would explain by omitting something else Nor is this morbid species of sagacity by any means to be looked upon as a literary novelty Justus Lipsius a scholar of no ordinary skill seems to revel in the imaginary discovery that the tragedies attributed to Seneca are by four different authors34 Now I will venture to assert that these tragedies are so uniform not only in their borrowed phraseologya phraseology with which writers like Boethius and Saxo Grammaticus were more charmed than ourselvesin their freedom from real poetry and last but not least in an ultrarefined and consistent abandonment of good taste that few writers of the present day would question the capabilities of the same gentleman be he Seneca or not to produce not only these but a great many more equally bad With equal sagacity Father Hardouin astonished the world with the startling announcement that the neid of Virgil and the satires of Horace were literary deceptions Now without wishing to say one word of disrespect against the industry and learningnay the refined acutenesswhich scholars like Wolf have bestowed upon this subject I must express my fears that many of our modern Homeric theories will become matter for the surprise and entertainment rather than the instruction of posterity Nor can I help thinking that the literary history of more recent times will account for many points of difficulty in the transmission of the Iliad and Odyssey to a period so remote from that of their first creation I have already expressed my belief that the labours of Peisistratus were of a purely editorial character and there seems no more reason why corrupt and imperfect editions of Homer may not have been abroad in his day than that the poems of Valerius Flaccus and Tibullus should have given so much trouble to Poggio Scaliger and others But after all the main fault in all the Homeric theories is that they demand too great a sacrifice of those feelings to which poetry most powerfully appeals and which are its most fitting judges The ingenuity which has sought to rob us of the name and existence of Homer does too much violence to that inward emotion which makes our whole soul yearn with love and admiration for the blind bard of Chios To believe the author of the Iliad a mere compiler is to degrade the powers of human invention to elevate analytical judgment at the expense of the most ennobling impulses of the soul and to forget the ocean in the contemplation of a polypus There is a catholicity so to speak in the very name of Homer Our faith in the author of the Iliad may be a mistaken one but as yet nobody has taught us a better While however I look upon the belief in Homer as one that has nature herself for its mainspring while I can join with old Ennius in believing in Homer as the ghost who like some patron saint hovers round the bed of the poet and even bestows rare gifts from that wealth of imagination which a host of imitators could not exhauststill I am far from wishing to deny that the author of these great poems found a rich fund of tradition a wellstocked mythical storehouse from whencepg xxvii he might derive both subject and embellishment But it is one thing to use existing romances in the embellishment of a poem another to patch up the poem itself from such materials What consistency of style and execution can be hoped for from such an attempt or rather what bad taste and tedium will not be the infallible result A blending of popular legends and a free use of the songs of other bards are features perfectly consistent with poetical originality In fact the most original writer is still drawing upon outward impressionsnay even his own thoughts are a kind of secondary agents which support and feed the impulses of imagination But unless there be some grand pervading principlesome invisible yet most distinctly stamped archetypus of the great whole a poem like the Iliad can never come to the birth Traditions the most picturesque episodes the most pathetic local associations teeming with the thoughts of gods and great men may crowd in one mighty vision or reveal themselves in more substantial forms to the mind of the poet but except the power to create a grand whole to which these shall be but as details and embellishments be present we shall have nought but a scrapbook a parterre filled with flowers and weeds strangling each other in their wild redundancy we shall have a cento of rags and tatters which will require little acuteness to detect Sensible as I am of the difficulty of disproving a negative and aware as I must be of the weighty grounds there are for opposing my belief it still seems to me that the Homeric question is one that is reserved for a higher criticism than it has often obtained We are not by nature intended to know all things still less to compass the powers by which the greatest blessings of life have been placed at our disposal Were faith no virtue then we might indeed wonder why God willed our ignorance on any matter But we are too well taught the contrary lesson and it seems as though our faith should be especially tried touching the men and the events which have wrought most influence upon the condition of humanity And there is a kind of sacredness attached to the memory of the great and the good which seems to bid us repulse the scepticism which would allegorize their existence into a pleasing apologue and measure the giants of intellect by an homeopathic dynameter Long and habitual reading of Homer appears to familiarize our thoughts even to his incongruities or rather if we read in a right spirit and with a heartfelt appreciation we are too much dazzled too deeply wrapped in admiration of the whole to dwell upon the minute spots which mere analysis can discover In reading an heroic poem we must transform ourselves into heroes of the time being we in imagination must fight over the same battles woo the same loves burn with the same sense of injury as an Achilles or a Hector And if we can but attain this degree of enthusiasm and less enthusiasm will scarcely suffice for the reading of Homer we shall feel that the poems of Homer are not only the work of one writer but of the greatest writer that ever touched the hearts of men by the power of song And it was this supposed unity of authorship which gave these poems their powerful influence over the minds of the men of oldpg xxviii Heeren who is evidently little disposed in favour of modern theories finely observes It was Homer who formed the character of the Greek nation No poet has ever as a poet exercised a similar influence over his countrymen Prophets lawgivers and sages have formed the character of other nations it was reserved to a poet to form that of the Greeks This is a feature in their character which was not wholly erased even in the period of their degeneracy When lawgivers and sages appeared in Greece the work of the poet had already been accomplished and they paid homage to his superior genius He held up before his nation the mirror in which they were to behold the world of gods and heroes no less than of feeble mortals and to behold them reflected with purity and truth His poems are founded on the first feeling of human nature on the love of children wife and country on that passion which outweighs all others the love of glory His songs were poured forth from a breast which sympathized with all the feelings of man and therefore they enter and will continue to enter every breast which cherishes the same sympathies If it is granted to his immortal spirit from another heaven than any of which he dreamed on earth to look down on his race to see the nations from the fields of Asia to the forests of Hercynia performing pilgrimages to the fountain which his magic wand caused to flow if it is permitted to him to view the vast assemblage of grand of elevated of glorious productions which had been called into being by means of his songs wherever his immortal spirit may reside this alone would suffice to complete his happiness35Can we contemplate that ancient monument on which the Apotheosis of Homer36 is depictured and not feel how much of pleasing association how much that appeals most forcibly and most distinctly to our minds is lost by the admittance of any theory but our old tradition The more we read and the more we thinkthink as becomes the readers of Homerthe more rooted becomes the conviction that the Father of Poetry gave us this rich inheritance whole and entire Whatever were the means of its preservation let us rather be thankful for the treasury of taste and eloquence thus laid open to our use than seek to make it a mere centre around which to drive a series of theories whose wildness is only equalled by their inconsistency with each other As the hymns and some other poems usually ascribed to Homer are not included in Popes translation I will content myself with a brief account of the Battle of the Frogs and Mice from the pen of a writer who has done it full justice37This poem says Coleridge is a short mockheroic of ancient date The text varies in different editions and is obviously disturbed and corrupt to a great degree it is commonly said to have been a juvenile essay of Homers genius others have attributed it to the same Pigreespg xxixmentioned above and whose reputation for humour seems to have invited the appropriation of any piece of ancient wit the author of which was uncertain so little did the Greeks before the age of the Ptolemies know or care about that department of criticism employed in determining the genuineness of ancient writings As to this little poem being a youthful prolusion of Homer it seems sufficient to say that from the beginning to the end it is a plain and palpable parody not only of the general spirit but of the numerous passages of the Iliad itself and even if no such intention to parody were discernible in it the objection would still remain that to suppose a work of mere burlesque to be the primary effort of poetry in a simple age seems to reverse that order in the development of national taste which the history of every other people in Europe and of many in Asia has almost ascertained to be a law of the human mind it is in a state of society much more refined and permanent than that described in the Iliad that any popularity would attend such a ridicule of war and the gods as is contained in this poem and the fact of there having existed three other poems of the same kind attributed for aught we can see with as much reason to Homer is a strong inducement to believe that none of them were of the Homeric age Knight infers from the usage of the word deltos writing tablet instead of diphthera skin which according to Herod 5 58 was the material employed by the Asiatic Greeks for that purpose that this poem was another offspring of Attic ingenuity and generally that the familiar mention of the cock v 191 is a strong argument against so ancient a date for its composition Having thus given a brief account of the poems comprised in Popes design I will now proceed to make a few remarks on his translation and on my own purpose in the present edition Pope was not a Grecian His whole education had been irregular and his earliest acquaintance with the poet was through the version of Ogilby It is not too much to say that his whole work bears the impress of a disposition to be satisfied with the general sense rather than to dive deeply into the minute and delicate features of language Hence his whole work is to be looked upon rather as an elegant paraphrase than a translation There are to be sure certain conventional anecdotes which prove that Pope consulted various friends whose classical attainments were sounder than his own during the undertaking but it is probable that these examinations were the result rather of the contradictory versions already existing than of a desire to make a perfect transcript of the original And in those days what is called literal translation was less cultivated than at present If something like the general sense could be decorated with the easy gracefulness of a practised poet if the charms of metrical cadence and a pleasing fluency could be made consistent with a fair interpretation of the poets meaning his words were less jealously sought for and those who could read so good a poem as Popes Iliad had fair reason to be satisfied It would be absurd therefore to test Popes translation by our own advancing knowledge of the original text We must be content topg xxx look at it as a most delightful work in itselfa work which is as much a part of English literature as Homer himself is of Greek We must not be torn from our kindly associations with the old Iliad that once was our most cherished companion or our most lookedfor prize merely because Buttmann Loewe and Liddell have made us so much more accurate as to amphikupellon being an adjective and not a substantive Far be it from us to defend the faults of Pope especially when we think of Chapmans fine bold rough old Englishfar be it from us to hold up his translation as what a translation of Homer might be But we can still dismiss Popes Iliad to the hands of our readers with the consciousness that they must have read a very great number of books before they have read its fellow As to the Notes accompanying the present volume they are drawn up without pretension and mainly with the view of helping the general reader Having some little time since translated all the works of Homer for another publisher I might have brought a large amount of accumulated matter sometimes of a critical character to bear upon the text But Popes version was no field for such a display and my purpose was to touch briefly on antiquarian or mythological allusions to notice occasionally some departures from the original and to give a few parallel passages from our English Homer Milton In the latter task I cannot pretend to novelty but I trust that my other annotations while utterly disclaiming high scholastic views will be found to convey as much as is wanted at least as far as the necessary limits of these volumes

"POPES PREFACE TO THE ILIAD OF HOMERHomer is universally allowed to have had the greatest invention of any writer whatever The praise of judgment Virgil has justly contested with him and others may have their pretensions as to particular excellences but his invention remains yet unrivalled Nor is it a wonder if he has ever been acknowledged the greatest of poets who most excelled in that which is the very foundation of poetry It is the invention that in different degrees distinguishes all great geniuses the utmost stretch of human study learning and industry which masters everything besides can never attain to this It furnishes art with all her materials and without it judgment itself can at best but steal wisely for art is only like a prudent steward that lives on managing the riches of nature Whatever praises may be given to works of judgment there is not even a single beauty in them to which the invention must not contribute as in the most regular gardens art can only reduce beauties of nature to more regularity and such a figure which the common eye may better take in and is therefore more entertained with And perhaps the reason why common critics are inclined to prefer a judicious and methodical genius to a great and fruitful one is because they find it easier for themselves to pursue their observations through a uniform and bounded walk of art than to comprehend the vast and various extent of nature Our authors work is a wild paradise where if we cannot see all the beauties so distinctly as in an ordered garden it is only because the number of them is infinitely greater It is like a copious nursery which contains the seeds and first productions of every kind out of which those who followed him have but selected some particular plants each according to his fancy to cultivate and beautify If some things are too luxuriant it is owing to the richness of the soil and if others are not arrived to perfection or maturity it is only because they are overrun and oppressed by those of a stronger nature It is to the strength of this amazing invention we are to attribute that unequalled fire and rapture which is so forcible in Homer that no man of a true poetical spirit is master of himself while he reads him What he writes is of the most animated nature imaginable every thing moves every thing lives and is put in action If a council be called or a battle fought you are not coldly informed of what was saidpg xxxii or done as from a third person the reader is hurried out of himself by the force of the poets imagination and turns in one place to a hearer in another to a spectator The course of his verses resembles that of the army he describes Hoid ar isan hosei te puri chthon pasa nemoito",
"They pour along like a fire that sweeps the whole earth before it It is however remarkable that his fancy which is everywhere vigorous is not discovered immediately at the beginning of his poem in its fullest splendour it grows in the progress both upon himself and others and becomes on fire like a chariotwheel by its own rapidity Exact disposition just thought correct elocution polished numbers may have been found in a thousand but this poetic fire this vivida vis animi in a very few Even in works where all those are imperfect or neglected this can overpower criticism and make us admire even while we disapprove Nay where this appears though attended with absurdities it brightens all the rubbish about it till we see nothing but its own splendour This fire is discerned in Virgil but discerned as through a glass reflected from Homer more shining than fierce but everywhere equal and constant in Lucan and Statius it bursts out in sudden short and interrupted flashes In Milton it glows like a furnace kept up to an uncommon ardour by the force of art in Shakspeare it strikes before we are aware like an accidental fire from heaven but in Homer and in him only it burns everywhere clearly and everywhere irresistibly I shall here endeavour to show how this vast invention exerts itself in a manner superior to that of any poet through all the main constituent parts of his work as it is the great and peculiar characteristic which distinguishes him from all other authors This strong and ruling faculty was like a powerful star which in the violence of its course drew all things within its vortex It seemed not enough to have taken in the whole circle of arts and the whole compass of nature to supply his maxims and reflections all the inward passions and affections of mankind to furnish his characters and all the outward forms and images of things for his descriptions but wanting yet an ampler sphere to expatiate in he opened a new and boundless walk for his imagination and created a world for himself in the invention of fable That which Aristotle calls the soul of poetry was first breathed into it by Homer I shall begin with considering him in his part as it is naturally the first and I speak of it both as it means the design of a poem and as it is taken for fiction Fable may be divided into the probable the allegorical and the marvellous The probable fable is the recital of such actions as though they did not happen yet might in the common course of nature or of such as though they did became fables by the additional episodes and manner of telling them Of this sort is the main story of an epic poem The return of Ulysses the settlement of the Trojans in Italy or the like That of the Iliad is the anger of Achilles the most short and single subject that ever was chosen by any poet Yet this he has supplied with a vaster variety of incidentspg xxxiii and events and crowded with a greater number of councils speeches battles and episodes of all kinds than are to be found even in those poems whose schemes are of the utmost latitude and irregularity The action is hurried on with the most vehement spirit and its whole duration employs not so much as fifty days Virgil for want of so warm a genius aided himself by taking in a more extensive subject as well as a greater length of time and contracting the design of both Homers poems into one which is yet but a fourth part as large as his The other epic poets have used the same practice but generally carried it so far as to superinduce a multiplicity of fables destroy the unity of action and lose their readers in an unreasonable length of time Nor is it only in the main design that they have been unable to add to his invention but they have followed him in every episode and part of story If he has given a regular catalogue of an army they all draw up their forces in the same order If he has funeral games for Patroclus Virgil has the same for Anchises and Statius rather than omit them destroys the unity of his actions for those of Archemorus If Ulysses visit the shades the neas of Virgil and Scipio of Silius are sent after him If he be detained from his return by the allurements of Calypso so is neas by Dido and Rinaldo by Armida If Achilles be absent from the army on the score of a quarrel through half the poem Rinaldo must absent himself just as long on the like account If he gives his hero a suit of celestial armour Virgil and Tasso make the same present to theirs Virgil has not only observed this close imitation of Homer but where he had not led the way supplied the want from other Greek authors Thus the story of Sinon and the taking of Troy was copied says Macrobius almost word for word from Pisander as the loves of Dido and neas are taken from those of Medea and Jason in Apollonius and several others in the same manner To proceed to the allegorical fable If we reflect upon those innumerable knowledges those secrets of nature and physical philosophy which Homer is generally supposed to have wrapped up in his allegories what a new and ample scene of wonder may this consideration afford us How fertile will that imagination appear which as able to clothe all the properties of elements the qualifications of the mind the virtues and vices in forms and persons and to introduce them into actions agreeable to the nature of the things they shadowed This is a field in which no succeeding poets could dispute with Homer and whatever commendations have been allowed them on this head are by no means for their invention in having enlarged his circle but for their judgment in having contracted it For when the mode of learning changed in the following ages and science was delivered in a plainer manner it then became as reasonable in the more modern poets to lay it aside as it was in Homer to make use of it And perhaps it was no unhappy circumstance for Virgil that there was not in his time that demand upon him of so great an invention as might be capable of furnishing all those allegorical parts of a poem The marvellous fable includes whatever is supernatural and especially the machines of the gods If Homer was not the first who introduced the deities as Herodotus imagines into the religion ofpg xxxiv Greece he seems the first who brought them into a system of machinery for poetry and such a one as makes its greatest importance and dignity for we find those authors who have been offended at the literal notion of the gods constantly laying their accusation against Homer as the chief support of it But whatever cause there might be to blame his machines in a philosophical or religious view they are so perfect in the poetic that mankind have been ever since contented to follow them none have been able to enlarge the sphere of poetry beyond the limits he has set every attempt of this nature has proved unsuccessful and after all the various changes of times and religions his gods continue to this day the gods of poetry We come now to the characters of his persons and here we shall find no author has ever drawn so many with so visible and surprising a variety or given us such lively and affecting impressions of them Every one has something so singularly his own that no painter could have distinguished them more by their features than the poet has by their manners Nothing can be more exact than the distinctions he has observed in the different degrees of virtues and vices The single quality of courage is wonderfully diversified in the several characters of the Iliad That of Achilles is furious and intractable that of Diomede forward yet listening to advice and subject to command that of Ajax is heavy and selfconfiding of Hector active and vigilant the courage of Agamemnon is inspirited by love of empire and ambition that of Menelaus mixed with softness and tenderness for his people we find in Idomeneus a plain direct soldier in Sarpedon a gallant and generous one Nor is this judicious and astonishing diversity to be found only in the principal quality which constitutes the main of each character but even in the under parts of it to which he takes care to give a tincture of that principal one For example the main characters of Ulysses and Nestor consist in wisdom and they are distinct in this that the wisdom of one is artificial and various of the other natural open and regular But they have besides characters of courage and this quality also takes a different turn in each from the difference of his prudence for one in the war depends still upon caution the other upon experience It would be endless to produce instances of these kinds The characters of Virgil are far from striking us in this open manner they lie in a great degree hidden and undistinguished and where they are marked most evidently affect us not in proportion to those of Homer His characters of valour are much alike even that of Turnus seems no way peculiar but as it is in a superior degree and we see nothing that differences the courage of Mnestheus from that of Sergestus Cloanthus or the rest In like manner it may be remarked of Statiuss heroes that an air of impetuosity runs through them all the same horrid and savage courage appears in his Capaneus Tydeus Hippomedon c They have a parity of character which makes them seem brothers of one family I believe when the reader is led into this tract of reflection if he will pursue it through the epic and tragic writers he will be convinced how infinitely superior in this point the invention of Homer was to that of all otherspg xxxv",
"The speeches are to be considered as they flow from the characters being perfect or defective as they agree or disagree with the manners of those who utter them As there is more variety of characters in the Iliad so there is of speeches than in any other poem Everything in it has manner as Aristotle expresses it that is everything is acted or spoken It is hardly credible in a work of such length how small a number of lines are employed in narration In Virgil the dramatic part is less in proportion to the narrative and the speeches often consist of general reflections or thoughts which might be equally just in any persons mouth upon the same occasion As many of his persons have no apparent characters so many of his speeches escape being applied and judged by the rule of propriety We oftener think of the author himself when we read Virgil than when we are engaged in Homer all which are the effects of a colder invention that interests us less in the action described Homer makes us hearers and Virgil leaves us readers If in the next place we take a view of the sentiments the same presiding faculty is eminent in the sublimity and spirit of his thoughts Longinus has given his opinion that it was in this part Homer principally excelled What were alone sufficient to prove the grandeur and excellence of his sentiments in general is that they have so remarkable a parity with those of the Scripture Duport in his Gnomologia Homerica has collected innumerable instances of this sort And it is with justice an excellent modern writer allows that if Virgil has not so many thoughts that are low and vulgar he has not so many that are sublime and noble and that the Roman author seldom rises into very astonishing sentiments where he is not fired by the Iliad If we observe his descriptions images and similes we shall find the invention still predominant To what else can we ascribe that vast comprehension of images of every sort where we see each circumstance of art and individual of nature summoned together by the extent and fecundity of his imagination to which all things in their various views presented themselves in an instant and had their impressions taken off to perfection at a heat Nay he not only gives us the full prospects of things but several unexpected peculiarities and side views unobserved by any painter but Homer Nothing is so surprising as the descriptions of his battles which take up no less than half the Iliad and are supplied with so vast a variety of incidents that no one bears a likeness to another such different kinds of deaths that no two heroes are wounded in the same manner and such a profusion of noble ideas that every battle rises above the last in greatness horror and confusion It is certain there is not near that number of images and descriptions in any epic poet though every one has assisted himself with a great quantity out of him and it is evident of Virgil especially that he has scarce any comparisons which are not drawn from his master If we descend from hence to the expression we see the bright imagination of Homer shining out in the most enlivened forms of it We acknowledge him the father of poetical diction the first who taught that language of the gods to men His expression is likepg xxxvi the colouring of some great masters which discovers itself to be laid on boldly and executed with rapidity It is indeed the strongest and most glowing imaginable and touched with the greatest spirit Aristotle had reason to say he was the only poet who had found out living words there are in him more daring figures and metaphors than in any good author whatever An arrow is impatient to be on the wing a weapon thirsts to drink the blood of an enemy and the like yet his expression is never too big for the sense but justly great in proportion to it It is the sentiment that swells and fills out the diction which rises with it and forms itself about it for in the same degree that a thought is warmer an expression will be brighter as that is more strong this will become more perspicuous like glass in the furnace which grows to a greater magnitude and refines to a greater clearness only as the breath within is more powerful and the heat more intense To throw his language more out of prose Homer seems to have affected the compound epithets This was a sort of composition peculiarly proper to poetry not only as it heightened the diction but as it assisted and filled the numbers with greater sound and pomp and likewise conduced in some measure to thicken the images On this last consideration I cannot but attribute these also to the fruitfulness of his invention since as he has managed them they are a sort of supernumerary pictures of the persons or things to which they were joined We see the motion of Hectors plumes in the epithet Korythaiolos the landscape of Mount Neritus in that of Einosiphyllos and so of others which particular images could not have been insisted upon so long as to express them in a description though but of a single line without diverting the reader too much from the principal action or figure As a metaphor is a short simile one of these epithets is a short description Lastly if we consider his versification we shall be sensible what a share of praise is due to his invention in that also He was not satisfied with his language as he found it settled in any one part of Greece but searched through its different dialects with this particular view to beautify and perfect his numbers he considered these as they had a greater mixture of vowels or consonants and accordingly employed them as the verse required either a greater smoothness or strength What he most affected was the Ionic which has a peculiar sweetness from its never using contractions and from its custom of resolving the diphthongs into two syllables so as to make the words open themselves with a more spreading and sonorous fluency With this he mingled the Attic contractions the broader Doric and the feebler olic which often rejects its aspirate or takes off its accent and completed this variety by altering some letters with the licence of poetry Thus his measures instead of being fetters to his sense were always in readiness to run along with the warmth of his rapture and even to give a further representation of his notions in the correspondence of their sounds to what they signified Out of all these he has derived that harmony which makes us confess he had not only the richest head but the finest ear in the world This is so great a truth that whoever will butpg xxxvii consult the tune of his verses even without understanding them with the same sort of diligence as we daily see practised in the case of Italian operas will find more sweetness variety and majesty of sound than in any other language of poetry The beauty of his numbers is allowed by the critics to be copied but faintly by Virgil himself though they are so just as to ascribe it to the nature of the Latin tongue indeed the Greek has some advantages both from the natural sound of its words and the turn and cadence of its verse which agree with the genius of no other language Virgil was very sensible of this and used the utmost diligence in working up a more intractable language to whatsoever graces it was capable of and in particular never failed to bring the sound of his line to a beautiful agreement with its sense If the Grecian poet has not been so frequently celebrated on this account as the Roman the only reason is that fewer critics have understood one language than the other Dionysius of Halicarnassus has pointed out many of our authors beauties in this kind in his treatise of the Composition of Words It suffices at present to observe of his numbers that they flow with so much ease as to make one imagine Homer had no other care than to transcribe as fast as the Muses dictated and at the same time with so much force and inspiriting vigour that they awaken and raise us like the sound of a trumpet They roll along as a plentiful river always in motion and always full while we are borne away by a tide of verse the most rapid and yet the most smooth imaginable Thus on whatever side we contemplate Homer what principally strikes us is his invention It is that which forms the character of each part of his work and accordingly we find it to have made his fable more extensive and copious than any other his manners more lively and strongly marked his speeches more affecting and transported his sentiments more warm and sublime his images and descriptions more full and animated his expression more raised and daring and his numbers more rapid and various I hope in what has been said of Virgil with regard to any of these heads I have no way derogated from his character Nothing is more absurd or endless than the common method of comparing eminent writers by an opposition of particular passages in them and forming a judgment from thence of their merit upon the whole We ought to have a certain knowledge of the principal character and distinguishing excellence of each it is in that we are to consider him and in proportion to his degree in that we are to admire him No author or man ever excelled all the world in more than one faculty and as Homer has done this in invention Virgil has in judgment Not that we are to think that Homer wanted judgment because Virgil had it in a more eminent degree or that Virgil wanted invention because Homer possessed a larger share of it each of these great authors had more of both than perhaps any man besides and are only said to have less in comparison with one another Homer was the greater genius Virgil the better artist In one we most admire the man in the other the work Homer hurries and transports us with a commanding impetuosity Virgil leads us with an attractive majesty Homer scatters with a generous profusionpg xxxviii Virgil bestows with a careful magnificence Homer like the Nile pours out his riches with a boundless overflow Virgil like a river in its banks with a gentle and constant stream When we behold their battles methinks the two poets resemble the heroes they celebrate Homer boundless and resistless as Achilles bears all before him and shines more and more as the tumult increases Virgil calmly daring like neas appears undisturbed in the midst of the action disposes all about him and conquers with tranquillity And when we look upon their machines Homer seems like his own Jupiter in his terrors shaking Olympus scattering the lightnings and firing the heavens Virgil like the same power in his benevolence counselling with the gods laying plans for empires and regularly ordering his whole creation But after all it is with great parts as with great virtues they naturally border on some imperfection and it is often hard to distinguish exactly where the virtue ends or the fault begins As prudence may sometimes sink to suspicion so may a great judgment decline to coldness and as magnanimity may run up to profusion or extravagance so may a great invention to redundancy or wildness If we look upon Homer in this view we shall perceive the chief objections against him to proceed from so noble a cause as the excess of this faculty Among these we may reckon some of his marvellous fictions upon which so much criticism has been spent as surpassing all the bounds of probability Perhaps it may be with great and superior souls as with gigantic bodies which exerting themselves with unusual strength exceed what is commonly thought the due proportion of parts to become miracles in the whole and like the old heroes of that make commit something near extravagance amidst a series of glorious and inimitable performances Thus Homer has his speaking horses and Virgil his myrtles distilling blood where the latter has not so much as contrived the easy intervention of a deity to save the probability It is owing to the same vast invention that his similes have been thought too exuberant and full of circumstances The force of this faculty is seen in nothing more than in its inability to confine itself to that single circumstance upon which the comparison is grounded it runs out into embellishments of additional images which however are so managed as not to overpower the main one His similes are like pictures where the principal figure has not only its proportion given agreeable to the original but is also set off with occasional ornaments and prospects The same will account for his manner of heaping a number of comparisons together in one breath when his fancy suggested to him at once so many various and correspondent images The reader will easily extend this observation to more objections of the same kind If there are others which seem rather to charge him with a defect or narrowness of genius than an excess of it those seeming defects will be found upon examination to proceed wholly from the nature of the times he lived in Such are his grosser representations of the gods and the vicious and imperfect manners of his heroes but I must herepg xxxix speak a word of the latter as it is a point generally carried into extremes both by the censurers and defenders of Homer It must be a strange partiality to antiquity to think with Madame Dacier38 that those times and manners are so much the more excellent as they are more contrary to ours Who can be so prejudiced in their favour as to magnify the felicity of those ages when a spirit of revenge and cruelty joined with the practice of rapine and robbery reigned through the world when no mercy was shown but for the sake of lucre when the greatest princes were put to the sword and their wives and daughters made slaves and concubines On the other side I would not be so delicate as those modern critics who are shocked at the servile offices and mean employments in which we sometimes see the heroes of Homer engaged There is a pleasure in taking a view of that simplicity in opposition to the luxury of succeeding ages in beholding monarchs without their guards princes tending their flocks and princesses drawing water from the springs When we read Homer we ought to reflect that we are reading the most ancient author in the heathen world and those who consider him in this light will double their pleasure in the perusal of him Let them think they are growing acquainted with nations and people that are now no more that they are stepping almost three thousand years back into the remotest antiquity and entertaining themselves with a clear and surprising vision of things nowhere else to be found the only true mirror of that ancient world By this means alone their greatest obstacles will vanish and what usually creates their dislike will become a satisfaction This consideration may further serve to answer for the constant use of the same epithets to his gods and heroes such as the fardarting Phoebus the blueeyed Pallas the swiftfooted Achilles c which some have censured as impertinent and tediously repeated Those of the gods depended upon the powers and offices then believed to belong to them and had contracted a weight and veneration from the rites and solemn devotions in which they were used they were a sort of attributes with which it was a matter of religion to salute them on all occasions and which it was an irreverence to omit As for the epithets of great men Mons Boileau is of opinion that they were in the nature of surnames and repeated as such for the Greeks having no names derived from their fathers were obliged to add some other distinction of each person either naming his parents expressly or his place of birth profession or the like as Alexander the son of Philip Herodotus of Halicarnassus Diogenes the Cynic c Homer therefore complying with the custom of his country used such distinctive additions as better agreed with poetry And indeed we have something parallel to these in modern times such as the names of Harold Harefoot Edmund Ironside Edward Longshanks Edward the Black Prince c If yet this be thought to account better for the propriety than for the repetition I shall add a further conjecture Hesiod dividing the world into its different ages has placed a fourth age between the brazen and the iron one of heroes distinct from otherpg xl men a divine race who fought at Thebes and Troy are called demigods and live by the care of Jupiter in the islands of the blessed Now among the divine honours which were paid them they might have this also in common with the gods not to be mentioned without the solemnity of an epithet and such as might be acceptable to them by celebrating their families actions or qualities What other cavils have been raised against Homer are such as hardly deserve a reply but will yet be taken notice of as they occur in the course of the work Many have been occasioned by an injudicious endeavour to exalt Virgil which is much the same as if one should think to raise the superstructure by undermining the foundation one would imagine by the whole course of their parallels that these critics never so much as heard of Homers having written first a consideration which whoever compares these two poets ought to have always in his eye Some accuse him for the same things which they overlook or praise in the other as when they prefer the fable and moral of the neis to those of the Iliad for the same reasons which might set the Odyssey above the neis as that the hero is a wiser man and the action of the one more beneficial to his country than that of the other or else they blame him for not doing what he never designed as because Achilles is not as good and perfect a prince as neas when the very moral of his poem required a contrary character it is thus that Rapin judges in his comparison of Homer and Virgil Others select those particular passages of Homer which are not so laboured as some that Virgil drew out of them this is the whole management of Scaliger in his Poetics Others quarrel with what they take for low and mean expressions sometimes through a false delicacy and refinement oftener from an ignorance of the graces of the original and then triumph in the awkwardness of their own translations this is the conduct of Perrault in his Parallels Lastly there are others who pretending to a fairer proceeding distinguish between the personal merit of Homer and that of his work but when they come to assign the causes of the great reputation of the Iliad they found it upon the ignorance of his times and the prejudice of those that followed and in pursuance of this principle they make those accidents such as the contention of the cities c to be the causes of his fame which were in reality the consequences of his merit The same might as well be said of Virgil or any great author whose general character will infallibly raise many casual additions to their reputation This is the method of Mons de la Mott who yet confesses upon the whole that in whatever age Homer had lived he must have been the greatest poet of his nation and that he may be said in his sense to be the master even of those who surpassed him39In all these objections we see nothing that contradicts his title to the honour of the chief invention and as long as this which is indeed the characteristic of poetry itself remains unequalled by his followers he still continues superior to them A cooler judgment may commit fewer faults and be more approved in the eyes of one sort of critics but that warmth of fancy will carry the loudest and mostpg xli universal applauses which holds the heart of a reader under the strongest enchantment Homer not only appears the inventor of poetry but excels all the inventors of other arts in this that he has swallowed up the honour of those who succeeded him What he has done admitted no increase it only left room for contraction or regulation He showed all the stretch of fancy at once and if he has failed in some of his flights it was but because he attempted everything A work of this kind seems like a mighty tree which rises from the most vigorous seed is improved with industry flourishes and produces the finest fruit nature and art conspire to raise it pleasure and profit join to make it valuable and they who find the justest faults have only said that a few branches which run luxuriant through a richness of nature might be lopped into form to give it a more regular appearance Having now spoken of the beauties and defects of the original it remains to treat of the translation with the same view to the chief characteristic As far as that is seen in the main parts of the poem such as the fable manners and sentiments no translator can prejudice it but by wilful omissions or contractions As it also breaks out in every particular image description and simile whoever lessens or too much softens those takes off from this chief character It is the first grand duty of an interpreter to give his author entire and unmaimed and for the rest the diction and versification only are his proper province since these must be his own but the others he is to take as he finds them It should then be considered what methods may afford some equivalent in our language for the graces of these in the Greek It is certain no literal translation can be just to an excellent original in a superior language but it is a great mistake to imagine as many have done that a rash paraphrase can make amends for this general defect which is no less in danger to lose the spirit of an ancient by deviating into the modern manners of expression If there be sometimes a darkness there is often a light in antiquity which nothing better preserves than a version almost literal I know no liberties one ought to take but those which are necessary to transfusing the spirit of the original and supporting the poetical style of the translation and I will venture to say there have not been more men misled in former times by a servile dull adherence to the letter than have been deluded in ours by a chimerical insolent hope of raising and improving their author It is not to be doubted that the fire of the poem is what a translator should principally regard as it is most likely to expire in his managing however it is his safest way to be content with preserving this to his utmost in the whole without endeavouring to be more than he finds his author is in any particular place It is a great secret in writing to know when to be plain and when poetical and figurative and it is what Homer will teach us if we will but follow modestly in his footsteps Where his diction is bold and lofty let us raise ours as high as we can but where his is plain and humble we ought not to be deterred from imitating him by the fear of incurring the censure of a mere English critic Nothing that belongs to Homerpg xlii seems to have been more commonly mistaken than the just pitch of his style some of his translators having swelled into fustian in a proud confidence of the sublime others sunk into flatness in a cold and timorous notion of simplicity Methinks I see these different followers of Homer some sweating and straining after him by violent leaps and bounds the certain signs of false mettle others slowly and servilely creeping in his train while the poet himself is all the time proceeding with an unaffected and equal majesty before them However of the two extremes one could sooner pardon frenzy than frigidity no author is to be envied for such commendations as he may gain by that character of style which his friends must agree together to call simplicity and the rest of the world will call dulness There is a graceful and dignified simplicity as well as a bold and sordid one which differ as much from each other as the air of a plain man from that of a sloven it is one thing to be tricked up and another not to be dressed at all Simplicity is the mean between ostentation and rusticity This pure and noble simplicity is nowhere in such perfection as in the Scripture and our author One may affirm with all respect to the inspired writings that the Divine Spirit made use of no other words but what were intelligible and common to men at that time and in that part of the world and as Homer is the author nearest to those his style must of course bear a greater resemblance to the sacred books than that of any other writer This consideration together with what has been observed of the parity of some of his thoughts may methinks induce a translator on the one hand to give in to several of those general phrases and manners of expression which have attained a veneration even in our language from being used in the Old Testament as on the other to avoid those which have been appropriated to the Divinity and in a manner consigned to mystery and religion For a further preservation of this air of simplicity a particular care should be taken to express with all plainness those moral sentences and proverbial speeches which are so numerous in this poet They have something venerable and as I may say oracular in that unadorned gravity and shortness with which they are delivered a grace which would be utterly lost by endeavouring to give them what we call a more ingenious that is a more modern turn in the paraphrase Perhaps the mixture of some Graecisms and old words after the manner of Milton if done without too much affectation might not have an ill effect in a version of this particular work which most of any other seems to require a venerable antique cast But certainly the use of modern terms of war and government such as platoon campaign junto or the like into which some of his translators have fallen cannot be allowable those only excepted without which it is impossible to treat the subjects in any living language There are two peculiarities in Homers diction which are a sort of marks or moles by which every common eye distinguishes him at first sight those who are not his greatest admirers look upon them as defects and those who are seemed pleased with them as beauties I speak of his compound epithets and of his repetitions Many of thepg xliii former cannot be done literally into English without destroying the purity of our language I believe such should be retained as slide easily of themselves into an English compound without violence to the ear or to the received rules of composition as well as those which have received a sanction from the authority of our best poets and are become familiar through their use of them such as my buttcompelling Jove c As for the rest whenever any can be as fully and significantly expressed in a single word as in a compounded one the course to be taken is obvious Some that cannot be so turned as to preserve their full image by one or two words may have justice done them by circumlocution as the epithet einosiphyllos to a mountain would appear little or ridiculous translated literally leafshaking but affords a majestic idea in the periphrasis the lofty mountain shakes his waving woods Others that admit of different significations may receive an advantage from a judicious variation according to the occasions on which they are introduced For example the epithet of Apollo hekaebolos or farshooting is capable of two explications one literal in respect of the darts and bow the ensigns of that god the other allegorical with regard to the rays of the sun therefore in such places where Apollo is represented as a god in person I would use the former interpretation and where the effects of the sun are described I would make choice of the latter Upon the whole it will be necessary to avoid that perpetual repetition of the same epithets which we find in Homer and which though it might be accommodated as has been already shown to the ear of those times is by no means so to ours but one may wait for opportunities of placing them where they derive an additional beauty from the occasions on which they are employed and in doing this properly a translator may at once show his fancy and his judgment As for Homers repetitions we may divide them into three sorts of whole narrations and speeches of single sentences and of one verse or hemistitch I hope it is not impossible to have such a regard to these as neither to lose so known a mark of the author on the one hand nor to offend the reader too much on the other The repetition is not ungraceful in those speeches where the dignity of the speaker renders it a sort of insolence to alter his words as in the messages from gods to men or from higher powers to inferiors in concerns of state or where the ceremonial of religion seems to require it in the solemn forms of prayers oaths or the like In other cases I believe the best rule is to be guided by the nearness or distance at which the repetitions are placed in the original when they follow too close one may vary the expression but it is a question whether a professed translator be authorized to omit any if they be tedious the author is to answer for it It only remains to speak of the versification Homer as has been said is perpetually applying the sound to the sense and varying it on every new subject This is indeed one of the most exquisite beauties of poetry and attainable by very few I only know of Homer eminent for it in the Greek and Virgil in the Latin I am sensible it is what may sometimes happen by chance when a writer is warm and fullypg xliv possessed of his image however it may reasonably be believed they designed this in whose verse it so manifestly appears in a superior degree to all others Few readers have the ear to be judges of it but those who have will see I have endeavoured at this beauty Upon the whole I must confess myself utterly incapable of doing justice to Homer I attempt him in no other hope but that which one may entertain without much vanity of giving a more tolerable copy of him than any entire translation in verse has yet done We have only those of Chapman Hobbes and Ogilby Chapman has taken the advantage of an immeasurable length of verse notwithstanding which there is scarce any paraphrase more loose and rambling than his He has frequent interpolations of four or six lines and I remember one in the thirteenth book of the Odyssey ver 312 where he has spun twenty verses out of two He is often mistaken in so bold a manner that one might think he deviated on purpose if he did not in other places of his notes insist so much upon verbal trifles He appears to have had a strong affectation of extracting new meanings out of his author insomuch as to promise in his rhyming preface a poem of the mysteries he had revealed in Homer and perhaps he endeavoured to strain the obvious sense to this end His expression is involved in fustian a fault for which he was remarkable in his original writings as in the tragedy of Bussy d Amboise c In a word the nature of the man may account for his whole performance for he appears from his preface and remarks to have been of an arrogant turn and an enthusiast in poetry His own boast of having finished half the Iliad in less than fifteen weeks shows with what negligence his version was performed But that which is to be allowed him and which very much contributed to cover his defects is a daring fiery spirit that animates his translation which is something like what one might imagine Homer himself would have writ before he arrived at years of discretion Hobbes has given us a correct explanation of the sense in general but for particulars and circumstances he continually lops them and often omits the most beautiful As for its being esteemed a close translation I doubt not many have been led into that error by the shortness of it which proceeds not from his following the original line by line but from the contractions above mentioned He sometimes omits whole similes and sentences and is now and then guilty of mistakes into which no writer of his learning could have fallen but through carelessness His poetry as well as Ogilbys is too mean for criticism It is a great loss to the poetical world that Mr Dryden did not live to translate the Iliad He has left us only the first book and a small part of the sixth in which if he has in some places not truly interpreted the sense or preserved the antiquities it ought to be excused on account of the haste he was obliged to write in He seems to have had too much regard to Chapman whose words he sometimes copies and has unhappily followed him in passages where he wanders from the original However had he translated the whole work I would no more have attempted Homer after him than Virgil his version of whom notwithstanding some human errors is the most noble and spirited translation I know in any language But the fate of great geniuses is likepg xlv that of great ministers though they are confessedly the first in the commonwealth of letters they must be envied and calumniated only for being at the head of it That which in my opinion ought to be the endeavour of any one who translates Homer is above all things to keep alive that spirit and fire which makes his chief character in particular places where the sense can bear any doubt to follow the strongest and most poetical as most agreeing with that character to copy him in all the variations of his style and the different modulations of his numbers to preserve in the more active or descriptive parts a warmth and elevation in the more sedate or narrative a plainness and solemnity in the speeches a fulness and perspicuity in the sentences a shortness and gravity not to neglect even the little figures and turns on the words nor sometimes the very cast of the periods neither to omit nor confound any rites or customs of antiquity perhaps too he ought to include the whole in a shorter compass than has hitherto been done by any translator who has tolerably preserved either the sense or poetry What I would further recommend to him is to study his author rather from his own text than from any commentaries how learned soever or whatever figure they may make in the estimation of the world to consider him attentively in comparison with Virgil above all the ancients and with Milton above all the moderns Next these the Archbishop of Cambrays Telemachus may give him the truest idea of the spirit and turn of our author and Bossus admirable Treatise of the Epic Poem the justest notion of his design and conduct But after all with whatever judgment and study a man may proceed or with whatever happiness he may perform such a work he must hope to please but a few those only who have at once a taste of poetry and competent learning For to satisfy such a want either is not in the nature of this undertaking since a mere modern wit can like nothing that is not modern and a pedant nothing that is not Greek What I have done is submitted to the public from whose opinions I am prepared to learn though I fear no judges so little as our best poets who are most sensible of the weight of this task As for the worst whatever they shall please to say they may give me some concern as they are unhappy men but none as they are malignant writers I was guided in this translation by judgments very different from theirs and by persons for whom they can have no kindness if an old observation be true that the strongest antipathy in the world is that of fools to men of wit Mr Addison was the first whose advice determined me to undertake this task who was pleased to write to me upon that occasion in such terms as I cannot repeat without vanity I was obliged to Sir Richard Steele for a very early recommendation of my undertaking to the public Dr Swift promoted my interest with that warmth with which he always serves his friend The humanity and frankness of Sir Samuel Garth are what I never knew wanting on any occasion I must also acknowledge with infinite pleasure the many friendly offices as well as sincere criticisms of Mr Congreve who had led me the way in translating some parts of Homer I must add the names of Mr Rowe and Dr Parnell though I shall take a further opportunity of doing justice to the last whose good nature topg xlvi give it a great panegyric is no less extensive than his learning The favour of these gentlemen is not entirely undeserved by one who bears them so true an affection But what can I say of the honour so many of the great have done me while the first names of the age appear as my subscribers and the most distinguished patrons and ornaments of learning as my chief encouragers Among these it is a particular pleasure to me to find that my highest obligations are to such who have done most honour to the name of poet that his grace the Duke of Buckingham was not displeased I should undertake the author to whom he has given in his excellent Essay

"That the Earl of Halifax was one of the first to favour me of whom it is hard to say whether the advancement of the polite arts is more owing to his generosity or his example that such a genius as my Lord Bolingbroke not more distinguished in the great scenes of business than in all the useful and entertaining parts of learning has not refused to be the critic of these sheets and the patron of their writer and that the noble author of the tragedy of Heroic Love has continued his partiality to me from my writing pastorals to my attempting the Iliad I cannot deny myself the pride of confessing that I have had the advantage not only of their advice for the conduct in general but their correction of several particulars of this translation I could say a great deal of the pleasure of being distinguished by the Earl of Carnarvon but it is almost absurd to particularize any one generous action in a person whose whole life is a continued series of them Mr Stanhope the present secretary of state will pardon my desire of having it known that he was pleased to promote this affair The particular zeal of Mr Harcourt the son of the late Lord Chancellor gave me a proof how much I am honoured in a share of his friendship I must attribute to the same motive that of several others of my friends to whom all acknowledgments are rendered unnecessary by the privileges of a familiar correspondence and I am satisfied I can no way better oblige men of their turn than by my silence In short I have found more patrons than ever Homer wanted He would have thought himself happy to have met the same favour at Athens that has been shown me by its learned rival the University of Oxford And I can hardly envy him those pompous honours he received after death when I reflect on the enjoyment of so many agreeable obligations and easy friendships which make the satisfaction of life This distinction is the more to be acknowledged as it is shown to one whose pen has never gratified the prejudices of particular parties or the vanities of particular men Whatever the success may prove I shall never repent of an undertaking in which I have experienced the candour and friendship of so many persons of merit and in which I hope to pass some of those years of youth that are generally lost in a circle of follies after a manner neither wholly unuseful to others nor disagreeable to myselfpg 001",
