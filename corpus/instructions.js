"INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING A SLIDE RULE",
"The slide rule is a device for easily and quickly multiplying dividing",
"and extracting square root and cube root It will also perform any",
"combination of these processes On this account it is found extremely",
"useful by students and teachers in schools and colleges by engineers",
"architects draftsmen surveyors chemists and many others Accountants",
"and clerks find it very helpful when approximate calculations must be",
"made rapidly The operation of a slide rule is extremely easy and it is",
"well worth while for anyone who is called upon to do much numerical",
"calculation to learn to use one It is the purpose of this manual to",
"explain the operation in such a way that a person who has never before",
"used a slide rule may teach himself to do so",
"DESCRIPTION OF SLIDE RULE",
"The slide rule consists of three parts see figure 1). B is the body of",
"the rule and carries three scales marked A D and K S is the slider",
"which moves relative to the body and also carries three scales marked B",
"CI and C R is the runner or indicator and is marked in the center with",
"a hair-line The scales A and B are identical and are used in problems",
"involving square root Scales C and D are also identical and are used",
"for multiplication and division Scale K is for finding cube root Scale",
"CI or C-inverse is like scale C except that it is laid off from right",
"to left instead of from left to right It is useful in problems",
"involving reciprocals MULTIPLICATION",
"We will start with a very simple example:",
"Example 1:  2 * 3 = 6",
"To prove this on the slide rule move the slider so that the 1 at the",
"left-hand end of the C scale is directly over the large 2 on the D scale",
"see figure 1). Then move the runner till the hair-line is over 3 on the",
"C scale Read the answer 6, on the D scale under the hair-line Now",
"let us consider a more complicated example:",
"Example 2:   2.12 * 3.16 = 6.70",
"As before set the 1 at the left-hand end of the C scale which we will",
"call the left-hand index of the C scale over 2.12 on the D scale See",
"figure 2). The hair-line of the runner is now placed over 3.16 on the C",
"scale and the answer 6.70, read on the D scale",
"METHOD OF MAKING SETTINGS",
"[This 6 inch rule uses fewer minor divisions]",
"In order to understand just why 2.12 is set where it is figure 2),",
"notice that the interval from 2 to 3 is divided into 10 large or major",
"divisions each of which is of course equal to one-tenth (0.1) of the",
"amount represented by the whole interval The major divisions are in",
"turn divided into 5 small or minor divisions each of which is one-fifth",
"or two-tenths (0.2) of the major division that is 0.02 of the",
"whole interval Therefore the index is set above",
"2 + 1 major division + 1 minor division = 2 + 0.1 + 0.02 = 2.12.",
"In the same way we find 3.16 on the C scale While we are on this",
"subject notice that in the interval from 1 to 2 the major divisions are",
"marked with the small figures 1 to 9 and the minor divisions are 0.1 of",
"the major divisions In the intervals from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4 the minor",
"divisions are 0.2 of the major divisions and for the rest of the D or",
"C scale the minor divisions are 0.5 of the major divisions",
"Reading the setting from a slide rule is very much like reading",
"measurements from a ruler Imagine that the divisions between 2 and 3 on",
"the D scale figure 2) are those of a ruler divided into tenths of a",
"foot and each tenth of a foot divided in 5 parts 0.02 of a foot long",
"Then the distance from one on the left-hand end of the D scale not",
"shown in figure 2) to one on the left-hand end of the C scale would he",
"2.12 feet Of course a foot rule is divided into parts of uniform",
"length while those on a slide rule get smaller toward the right-hand",
"end but this example may help to give an idea of the method of making",
"and reading settings Now consider another example",
"Example 3a:  2.12 * 7.35 = 15.6",
"If we set the left-hand index of the C scale over 2.12 as in the last",
"example we find that 7.35 on the C scale falls out beyond the body of",
"the rule In a case like this simply use the right-hand index of the C",
"scale If we set this over 2.12 on the D scale and move the runner to",
"7.35 on the C scale we read the result 15.6 on the D scale under the",
"hair-line",
"Now the question immediately arises why did we call the result 15.6",
"and not 1.56? The answer is that the slide rule takes no account of",
"decimal points Thus the settings would be identical for all of the",
"following products:",
"Example 3:",
"a:    2.12    *   7.35   =    15.6",
"b:   21.2     *   7.35   =   156.0",
"c:  212       *  73.5    = 15600.",
"d:    2.12    *    .0735 =      .156",
"e:     .00212 * 735      =      .0156",
"The most convenient way to locate the decimal point is to make a mental",
"multiplication using only the first digits in the given factors Then",
"place the decimal point in the slide rule result so that its value is",
"nearest that of the mental multiplication Thus in example 3a above we",
"can multiply 2 by 7 in our heads and see immediately that the decimal",
"point must be placed in the slide rule result 156 so that it becomes",
"15.6 which is nearest to 14. In example 3b (20 * 7 = 140), so we must",
"place the decimal point to give 156. The reader can readily verify the",
"other examples in the same way",
"Since the product of a number by a second number is the same as the",
"product of the second by the first it makes no difference which of the",
"two numbers is set first on the slide rule Thus an alternative way of",
"working example 2 would be to set the left-hand index of the C scale",
"over 3.16 on the D scale and move the runner to 2.12 on the C scale and",
"read the answer under the hair-line on the D scale",
"The A and B scales are made up of two identical halves each of which is",
"very similar to the C and D scales Multiplication can also be carried",
"out on either half of the A and B scales exactly as it is done on the C",
"and D scales However since the A and B scales are only half as long as",
"the C and D scales the accuracy is not as good It is sometimes",
"convenient to multiply on the A and B scales in more complicated",
"problems as we shall see later on",
"A group of examples follow which cover all the possible combination of",
"settings which can arise in the multiplication of two numbers Example",
"4:   20 * 3 = 60",
"5:   85 * 2 = 170",
"6:   45 * 35 = 1575",
"7:   151 * 42 = 6342",
"8:   6.5 * 15 = 97.5",
"9:   .34 * .08 = .0272",
"10:  75 * 26 = 1950",
"11:  .00054 * 1.4 = .000756",
"12:  11.1 * 2.7 = 29.97",
"13:  1.01 * 54 = 54.5",
"14:  3.14 * 25 = 78.5 DIVISION",
"Since multiplication and division are inverse processes division on a",
"slide rule is done by making the same settings as for multiplication",
"but in reverse order Suppose we have the example:",
"Example 15: (6.70 / 2.12) = 3.16",
"Set indicator over the dividend 6.70 on the D scale Move the slider",
"until the divisor 2.12 on the C scale is under the hair-line Then read",
"the result on the D scale under the left-hand index of the C scale As",
"in multiplication the decimal point must be placed by a separate",
"process Make all the digits except the first in both dividend and",
"divisor equal zero and mentally divide the resulting numbers Place the",
"decimal point in the slide rule result so that it is nearest to the",
"mental result In example 15, we mentally divide 6 by 2. Then we place",
"the decimal point in the slide rule result 316 so that it is 3.16 which",
"is nearest to 3.",
"A group of examples for practice in division follow: Example",
"16:   34 / 2 = 17",
"17:   49 / 7 = 7",
"18:  132 / 12 = 11",
"19:  480 / 16 = 30",
"20: 1.05 / 35 = .03",
"21: 4.32 / 12 = .36",
"22: 5.23 / 6.15 = .85",
"23: 17.1 / 4.5 = 3.8",
"24: 1895 / 6.06 = 313",
"25:   45 /.017 = 2647",
"THE CI SCALE",
"If we divide one (1) by any number the answer is called the reciprocal",
"of the number Thus one-half is the reciprocal of two one-quarter is",
"the reciprocal of four If we take any number say 14, and multiply it",
"by the reciprocal of another number say 2, we get:",
"Example 26: 14 * (1/2) = 7",
"which is the same as 14 divided by two This process can be carried out",
"directly on the slide rule by use of the CI scale Numbers on the CI",
"scale are reciprocals of those on the C scale Thus we see that 2 on the",
"CI scale comes directly over 0.5 or 1/2 on the C scale Similarly 4 on",
"the CI scale comes over 0.25 or 1/4 on the C scale and so on To do",
"example 26 by use of the CI scale proceed exactly as if you were going",
"to multiply in the usual manner except that you use the CI scale instead",
"of the C scale First set the left-hand index of the C scale over 14 on",
"the D scale Then move the indicator to 2 on the CI scale Read the",
"result 7, on the D scale under the hair-line This is really another",
"way of dividing THE READER IS ADVISED TO WORK EXAMPLES 16 TO 25 OVER",
"AGAIN BY USE OF THE CI SCALE",
"SQUARING AND SQUARE ROOT",
"If we take a number and multiply it by itself we call the result the",
"square of the number The process is called squaring the number If we",
"find the number which when multiplied by itself is equal to a given",
"number the former number is called the square root of the given number",
"The process is called extracting the square root of the number Both",
"these processes may be carried out on the A and D scales of a slide",
"rule For example:",
"Example 27: 4 * 4 = square( 4 ) = 16",
"Set indicator over 4 on D scale Read 16 on A scale under hair-line",
"Example 28: square( 25.4 )  = 646.0",
"The decimal point must be placed by mental survey We know that ",
"square( 25.4 ) must be a little larger than square( 25 ) = 625 so that ",
"it must be 646.0.",
"To extract a square root we set the indicator over the number on the A",
"scale and read the result under the hair-line on the D scale When we",
"examine the A scale we see that there are two places where any given",
"number may be set so we must have some way of deciding in a given case",
"which half of the A scale to use The rule is as follows:",
"a If the number is greater than one For an odd number of digits to",
"the left of the decimal point use the left-hand half of the A scale",
"For an even number of digits to the left of the decimal point use the",
"right-hand half of the A scale",
"b If the number is less than one For an odd number of zeros to the",
"right of the decimal point before the first digit not a zero use the",
"left-hand half of the A scale For none or any even number of zeros to",
"the right of the decimal point before the first digit not a zero use",
"the right-hand half of the A scale",
"Example 29: square_root( 157 ) = 12.5",
"Since we have an odd number of digits set indicator over 157 on",
"left-hand half of A scale Read 12.5 on the D scale under hair-line To",
"check the decimal point think of the perfect square nearest to 157. It",
"is 12 * 12 = 144, so that square_root(157) must be a little more than 12 or",
"12.5.",
"Example 30: square_root( .0037 ) = .0608",
"In this number we have an even number of zeros to the right of the",
"decimal point so we must set the indicator over 37 on the right-hand",
"half of the A scale Read 608 under the hair-line on D scale To place",
"the decimal point write:",
"square_root( .0037 ) = square_root( 37/10000 )",
"= 1/100 square_root( 37 )",
"The nearest perfect square to 37 is 6 * 6 = 36, so the answer should be",
"a little more than 0.06 or .0608. All of what has been said about use of",
"the A and D scales for squaring and extracting square root applies",
"equally well to the B and C scales since they are identical to the A and",
"D scales respectively",
"A number of examples follow for squaring and the extraction of square",
"root Example",
"31: square( 2 ) = 4",
"32: square( 15 ) = 225",
"33: square( 26 )  = 676",
"34: square( 19.65 ) = 386",
"35: square_root( 64 ) = 8",
"36: square_root( 6.4 ) = 2.53",
"37: square_root( 498 ) = 22.5",
"38: square_root( 2500 ) = 50",
"39: square_root( .16 ) = .04",
"40: square_root( .03 ) = .173",
"CUBING AND CUBE ROOT",
"If we take a number and multiply it by itself and then multiply the",
"result by the original number we get what is called the cube of the",
"original number This process is called cubing the number The reverse",
"process of finding the number which when multiplied by itself and then",
"by itself again is equal to the given number is called extracting the",
"cube root of the given number Thus since 5 * 5 * 5 = 125, 125 is the",
"cube of 5 and 5 is the cube root of 125.",
"To find the cube of any number on the slide rule set the indicator over",
"the number on the D scale and read the answer on the K scale under the",
"hair-line To find the cube root of any number set the indicator over",
"the number on the K scale and read the answer on the D scale under the",
"hair-line Just as on the A scale where there were two places where you",
"could set a given number on the K scale there are three places where a",
"number may be set To tell which of the three to use we must make use",
"of the following rule",
"a If the number is greater than one For 1, 4, 7, 10, etc digits to",
"the left of the decimal point use the left-hand third of the K scale",
"For 2, 5, 8, 11, etc digits to the left of the decimal point use the",
"middle third of the K scale For 3, 6, 9, 12, etc digits to the left",
"of the decimal point use the right-hand third of the K scale",
"b If the number is less than one We now tell which scale to use by",
"counting the number of zeros to the right of the decimal point before",
"the first digit not zero If there are 2, 5, 8, 11, etc zeros use the",
"left-hand third of the K scale If there are 1, 4, 7, 10, etc zeros",
"then use the middle third of the K scale If there are no zeros or 3, 6,",
"9, 12, etc zeros then use the right-hand third of the K scale For",
"example:",
"Example 41: cube_root( 185 ) = 5.70",
"Since there are 3 digits in the given number we set the indicator on",
"185 in the right-hand third of the K scale and read the result 570 on",
"the D scale We can place the decimal point by thinking of the nearest",
"perfect cube which is 125. Therefore the decimal point must be placed",
"so as to give 5.70, which is nearest to 5, the cube root of 125.",
"Example 42: cube_root( .034 ) = .324",
"Since there is one zero between the decimal point and the first digit",
"not zero we must set the indicator over 34 on the middle third of the K",
"scale We read the result 324 on the D scale The decimal point may be",
"placed as follows:",
"cube_root( .034 ) = cube_root( 34/1000  )",
"= 1/10 cube_root( 34 )",
"The nearest perfect cube to 34 is 27, so our answer must be close to",
"one-tenth of the cube root of 27 or nearly 0.3. Therefore we must place",
"the decimal point to give 0.324. A group of examples for practice in",
"extraction of cube root follows: Example",
"43: cube_root( 64 ) = 4",
"44: cube_root( 8 ) = 2",
"45: cube_root( 343 ) = 7",
"46: cube_root( .000715 ) = .0894",
"47: cube_root( .00715 ) = .193",
"48: cube_root( .0715 ) = .415",
"49: cube_root( .516 ) = .803",
"50: cube_root( 27.8 ) = 3.03",
"51: cube_root( 5.49 ) = 1.76",
"52: cube_root( 87.1 ) = 4.43",
"THE 1.5 AND 2/3 POWER",
"If the indicator is set over a given number on the A scale the number",
"under the hair-line on the K scale is the 1.5 power of the given",
"number If the indicator is set over a given number on the K scale the",
"number under the hair-line on the A scale is the 2/3 power of the given",
"number",
"4 to the 3/2 power is 8",
"8 to the 2/3 power is 4.",
"COMBINATIONS OF PROCESSES",
"A slide rule is especially useful where some combination of processes is",
"necessary like multiplying 3 numbers together and dividing by a third",
"Operations of this sort may be performed in such a way that the final",
"answer is obtained immediately without finding intermediate results",
"1. Multiplying several numbers together For example suppose it is",
"desired to multiply 4 * 8 * 6. Place the right-hand index of the C scale",
"over 4 on the D scale and set the indicator over 8 on the C scale Now",
"leaving the indicator where it is move the slider till the right-hand",
"index is under the hairline Now leaving the slider where it is move",
"the indicator until it is over 6 on the C scale and read the result",
"192, on the D scale This may be continued indefinitely and so as many",
"numbers as desired may be multiplied together",
"Example 53: 2.32 * 154 * .0375 * .56 = 7.54",
"2. Multiplication and division",
"Suppose we wish to do the following example:",
"Example 54:  (4 * 15) / 2.5  = 24",
"First divide 4 by 2.5. Set indicator over 4 on the D scale and move the",
"slider until 2.5 is under the hair-line The result of this division",
"1.6, appears under the left-hand index of the C scale We do not need to",
"write it down however but we can immediately move the indicator to 15",
"on the C scale and read the final result 24 on the D scale under the",
"hair-line Let us consider a more complicated problem of the same type:",
"Example 55: (30/7.5) * (2/4) * (4.5/5) * (1.5/3) = .9",
"First set indicator over 30 on the D scale and move slider until 7.5 on",
"the C scale comes under the hairline The intermediate result 4,",
"appears under the right-hand index of the C scale We do not need to",
"write it down but merely note it by moving the indicator until the",
"hair-line is over the right-hand index of the C scale Now we want to",
"multiply this result by 2, the next factor in the numerator Since two",
"is out beyond the body of the rule transfer the slider till the other",
"left-hand index of the C scale is under the hair-line and then move",
"the indicator to 2 on the C scale Thus successive division and",
"multiplication is continued until all the factors have been used The",
"order in which the factors are taken does not affect the result With a",
"little practice you will learn to take them in the order which will",
"require the fewest settings The following examples are for practice:",
"Example 56: (6/3.5) * (4/5) * (3.5/2.4) * (2.8/7) = .8",
"Example 57: 352 * (273/254) * (760/768) = 374",
"An alternative method of doing these examples is to proceed exactly as",
"though you were multiplying all the factors together except that",
"whenever you come to a number in the denominator you use the CI scale",
"instead of the C scale The reader is advised to practice both methods",

"very squadron should be such as none might hinder one another in advancing or falling off",
"6. That the distance between squadron and squadron should be more or less as the order of the enemy's fleet or ships should require whereof the captains and commanders of our fleet were to be very considerate",
"9. That the rear-admiral's squadron should keep most strict and special watch to see what squadrons or ships distressed of our fleet should need extraordinary relief and what advantage might be had upon the enemy that a speedy and present course might be taken to perform the service enjoined",
"13. That if any of our fleet happened to be [to] leeward of the enemy every of our ships should labour and endeavour what they might to take all opportunity to get to windward of them and to hold that advantage having once obtained it",
"14. That the captains and officers of every ship should have an especial care as much as in them lay to keep the enemies in continual fight without any respite or intermission to be offered them; which with the advantage of the wind if it might be had was thought the likeliest way to enforce them to bear up and entangle themselves or fall foul one of another in disorder and confusion",
"15. That an especial care should be had in every ship that the gunners should load some of their pieces with case shot handspikes nails bars of iron or with what else might do most mischief to the enemy's men upon every fit opportunity and to come near and lay the ordnance well to pass for that purpose which would be apt to do great spoil to the enemy",
"16. That the cabins in every ship should be broken down so far as was requisite to clear the way of the ordnance",
"17. That all beds and sacks in every ship should be disposed and used as bulwarks for defence against the shot of the enemy",
"18. That there should be ten eight six or four men to attend every piece of ordnance as the master gunner should choose out and assign them to their several places of service that every one of them might know what belonged properly to him to do And that this choice and assignation should be made with speed so as we might not be taken unprovided",
"19. That there should be one two or three men of good understanding and diligence according to the burden of every ship forthwith appointed to fill cartouches[3] of powder and to carry them in cases or barrels covered to their places assigned",
"20. That the hold in every ship should be rummaged and made predy[4] especially by the ship's sides and a carpenter with some man of trust appointed to go fore and after in hold to seek for shot that may come in under water; and that there should be provided in readiness plugs pieces of sheet lead and pieces of elm board to stop all leaks that might be found within board or without",
"21. That in every ship where any soldiers were aboard the men should be divided into two or three parts whereof only one part should fight at once and the rest should be in hold to be drawn up upon occasion to relieve and rescue the former",
"22. That the men in every ship should be kept as close as reasonably might be till the enemy's first volley of small shot should be past",
"24. That the master or boatswain of every ship by command of the captain should appoint a sufficient and select number of seamen to stand by and attend the sails",
"25. That more especially they should by like command appoint sufficient helmsmen to steer the ship",
"26. That the sailors and helmsmen should in no sort presume to depart or stir from their charge",
"27. That the mainyard foreyard and topsail sheets in every ship should be slung and the topsail yards if the wind were not too high; hereby to avoid the shooting down of sails",
"28. That there should be butts or hogsheads sawn into two parts filled with salt water set upon the upper and lower decks in several places convenient in every ship with buckets gowns and blankets to quench and put out wild-fire or other fire if need be",
"30. That if any of the ships belonging to any squadron or division happened to be absent or not ready in convenient time and place to keep and make good the order herein prescribed then every squadron and division should maintain these directions as near as they could although the number of ships in every division were the less without attending the coming in of all the ships of every division",
"31. And that these ten ships in regard of the munition and materials for the army and the horses which were carried in them should attend the rear-admiral and not engage themselves without order but should remain and expect such directions as might come from our admiral or rear-admiral",

"There was no difference between the articles for the admiral's squadron and those for the vice-admiral's and rear-admiral's save in the names of the ships of every division and that their squadrons had not any particular reserve nor above five or six ships apiece in the third division for want of ships to make up the number of nine; the munition and horse ships which belonged to their squadrons being unapt to fight and therefore disposed into a special division of ten ships by themselves to attend the general reserve",

"SALARIES AND ALLOWANCESToC",
"1.  With the exception of Postmasters in the cities Postmasters' salaries are based on a commission on the amount of postage on matter prepaid by stamps and posted at their offices viz: 40 per cent on the first $800 per annum or $200 per quarter and 25 per cent on the balance with a minimum salary of $10 per annum in cases where the postage on the matter pre-paid by stamps is less than $25. These salaries are to be revised every two years but in very special cases where there has been an exceptional increase of [16]revenue or work the case may be reported on for the Postmaster General's consideration",
"2.  In cases where the Postmaster is required to perform duty between the hours of 10 pm and 5 am 50 per cent instead of 40 per cent is allowed on the first $800 per annum or $200 per quarter of prepaid postage revenue provided always that the Postmaster General considers that there are sufficient grounds for such increased allowance",
"3.  Allowances for forward duty are made to Postmasters who are required to re-mail letters and papers for and from other offices",

"In no case however should the allowance for forward duty excel 12 per cent of the revenue of the offices—the correspondence for and from which is distributed",
"4.  When in consequence of any change in the Mail arrangements the forward duty performed by a Postmaster is either increased or diminished you should at once report to the Postmaster General what corresponding increase or diminution in the forward allowance [17]should be made so that the necessary adjustment may take effect from the date on which the change goes into operation",

"This queen of the garden loses not its diadem in the perfuming world The oil of roses or as it is commonly called the otto or attar of roses is procured contrary to so many opposite statements simply by distilling the roses with water",
"The otto or attar of rose of commerce is derived from the Rosa centifolia provincialis Very extensive rose farms exist at Adrianople Turkey in Europe; at Broussa now famous as the residence of Abd-el-Kader; and at Uslak Turkey in Asia; also at Ghazepore in India",
"The cultivators in Turkey are principally the Christian inhabitants of the low countries of the Balkan between Selimno and Carloya as far as Philippopolis in Bulgaria about 200 miles from Constantinople In good seasons this district yields 75,000 ounces; but in bad seasons only 20,000 to 30,000 ounces of attar are obtained It is estimated that it requires at least 2000 rose blooms to yield one drachm of otto",
"The otto slightly varies in odor from different districts; many places furnish an otto which solidifies more readily than others and therefore this is not a sure guide of purity though many consider it such That which was exhibited in the Crystal Palace of 1851, as from Ghazepore in India obtained the prize",
"Attar of roses made in Cashmere is considered superior to any other; a circumstance not surprising as according to Hugel the flower is here produced of surpassing fragrance as well as beauty A large quantity of rose-water twice distilled is allowed to run off into an open vessel placed over night in a cool running stream and in the morning the oil is found floating on the surface in minute specks which are taken off very carefully by means of a blade of sword-lily When cool it is of a dark green color and as hard as resin not becoming liquid at a temperature about that of boiling water Between 500 and 600 pounds' weight of leaves is required to produce one ounce of the attar—Indian Encyclopædia",
"Pure otto of roses from its cloying sweetness has not many admirers; when diluted however there is nothing to equal it in odor especially if mixed in soap to form rose soap or in pure spirit to form the esprit de rose The soap not allowing the perfume to evaporate very fast we cannot be surfeited with the smell of the otto",
"The finest preparation of rose as an odor is made at Grasse in France Here the flowers are not treated for the otto but are subjected to the process of maceration in fat or in oil as described under jasmine heliotrope &c",
"Some wholesale druggists have however been selling it now for some time to country practitioners for them to form extemporaneous rose-water which it does to great perfection Roses are cultivated to a large extent in England near Mitcham in Surrey for perfumers' use to make rose-water In the season when successive crops can be got which is about the end of June or the early part of July they are gathered as soon as the dew is off and sent to town in sacks When they arrive they are immediately spread out upon a cool floor: otherwise if left in a heap they heat to such an extent in two or three hours as to be quite spoiled There is no organic matter which so rapidly absorbs oxygen and becomes heated spontaneously as a mass of freshly gathered roses",
"To preserve these roses the London perfumers immediately pickle them; for this purpose the leaves are separated from the stalks and to every bushel of flowers equal to about six pounds' weight one pound of common salt is thoroughly rubbed in The salt absorbs the water existing in the petals and rapidly becomes brine reducing the whole to a pasty mass which is finally stowed away in casks In this way they will keep almost any length of time without the fragrance being seriously injured A good rose-water can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs of pickled roses and 2-1/2 gallons of water Draw off two gallons; the product will be the double-distilled rose-water of the shops The rose-water that is imported from the South of France is however very superior in odor to any that can be produced here As it is a residuary product of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar it has a richness of aroma which appears to be inimitable with English-grown roses There are four modifications of essence of rose for the handkerchief which are the ne plus ultra of the perfumer's art They are—esprit de rose triple essence of white of roses essence of tea rose and essence of moss rose The following are the recipes for their formation:—",

"Rectified alcohol  1 gallon",

"It is put up for sale in a similar way to eau de Cologne and is said to take its name from one of the queens of Hungary who is reported to have derived great benefit from a bath containing it at the age of seventy-five years There is no doubt that clergymen and orators while speaking for any time would derive great benefit from perfuming their handkerchief with Hungary water or eau de Cologne as the rosemary they contain excites the mind to vigorous action sufficient of the stimulant being inhaled by occasionally wiping the face with the handkerchief wetted with these waters Shakspeare giving us the key we can understand how it is that such perfumes containing rosemary are universally said to be so refreshing!",

"Santal—Santalum album",
"The santal tree perfumes when riven",
"The axe that laid it low Cameron",
"This is an old favorite with the lovers of scent; it is the wood that possesses the odor The finest santal-wood grows in the island of Timor and the Santal-wood Islands where it is extensively cultivated for the Chinese market In the religious ceremonies of the Brahmins Hindoos and Chinese santal-wood is burned by way of incense to an extent almost beyond belief The Santala grew plentifully in China but the continued offerings to the Buddahs have almost exterminated the plant from the Celestial Empire; and such is the demand that it is about to be cultivated in Western Australia in the expectation of a profitable return which we doubt not will be realized; England alone would consume tenfold the quantity it does were its price within the range of other perfuming substances The otto which exists in the santal-wood is readily procured by distillation; 1 cwt of good wood will yield about 30 ounces of otto",
"Santal-wood Santal-wood",
"The white ant which is so common in India and China eating into every organic matter that it comes across appears to have no relish for santal-wood; hence it is frequently made into caskets jewel-boxes deed-cases &c This quality together with its fragrance renders it a valuable article to the cabinet-makers of the East",
"The otto of santal is remarkably dense and is above all others oleaginous in its appearance and when good is of a dark straw color When dissolved in spirit it enters into the composition of a great many of the old-fashioned bouquets such as Marechale and others the formulæ of which will be given hereafter Perfumers thus make what is called",

"The odor of santal assimilates well with rose; and hence prior to the cultivation of rose-leaf geranium it was used to adulterate otto of roses; but is now but seldom used for that purpose",
"By a phonetic error santal is often printed sandal and sandel",
"Sassafras—Some of the perfumers of Germany use a tincture of the wood of the Laurus sassafras in the manufacture of hair-washes and other nostrums; but as in our opinion it has rather a physicky smell than flowery we cannot recommend the German recipes The Eau Athenienne notwithstanding has some reputation as a hair-water but is little else than a weak tincture of sassafras",
"Spike—French oil of lavender which is procured from the Lavandula spica is generally called oil of spike See Lavender",
"The power which these bodies have of fixing a volatile substance renders them valuable to the perfumer independent of their aroma which is due in many cases to benzoic acid slightly modified by an esential oil peculiar to each substance and which is taken up by the alcohol together with a portion of resin When the perfume is put upon a handkerchief the most volatile bodies disappear first: thus after the alcohol has evaporated the odor of the ottos appear stronger; if it contains any resinous body the ottos are held in solution as it were by the resin and thus retained on the fabric Supposing a perfume to be made of otto only without any fixing substance then as the perfume dies away the olfactory nerve if tutored will detect its composition for it spontaneously analyzes itself no two ottos having the same volatility: thus make a mixture of rose jasmine and patchouly; the jasmine predominates first then the rose and lastly the patchouly which will be found hours after the others have disappeared",
"Syringa—The flowers of the Philadelphus coronarius or common garden syringa have an intense odor resembling the orange-blossom; so much so that in America the plant is often termed mock orange A great deal of the pomatum sold as pommade surfin à la fleur d'orange by the manufacturers of Cannes is nothing more than fine suet perfumed with syringa blossoms by the maceration process Fine syringa pomade could be made in England at a quarter the cost of what is paid for the so-called orange pomatum",
"Thyme—All the different species of thyme but more particularly the lemon thyme the Thymus serpyllum as well as the marjorams origanum &c yield by distillation fragrant ottos that are extensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps; though well adapted for this purpose they do not answer at all in any other combinations Both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an herby smell very naturally rather than a flowery one and as a consequence they are not considered recherché.",
"When any of these herbs are dried and ground they usefully enter into the composition of sachet powders",
"Tonquin or Tonka—The seeds of the Dipterix odorata are the tonquin or coumarouma beans of commerce When fresh they are exceedingly fragrant having an intense odor of newly made hay The Anthoxanthum odoratum or sweet-smelling vernal grass to which new hay owes its odor probably yields identically the same fragrant principle and it is remarkable that both tonquin beans and vernal grass while actually growing are nearly scentless but become rapidly aromatic when severed from the parent stock",
"Chemically considered tonquin beans are very interesting containing when fresh a fragrant volatile otto to which their odor is principally due, benzoic acid a fat oil and a neutral principal—Coumarin In perfumery they are valuable as when ground they form with other bodies an excellent and permanent sachet and by infusion in spirit the tincture or extract of tonquin enters into a thousand of the compound essences; but on account of its great strength it must be used with caution otherwise people say your perfume is snuffy owing to the predominance of the odor and its well-known use in the boxes of those who indulge in the titillating dust",

"To preserve these roses the London perfumers immediately pickle them; for this purpose the leaves are separated from the stalks and to every bushel of flowers equal to about six pounds' weight one pound of common salt is thoroughly rubbed in The salt absorbs the water existing in the petals and rapidly becomes brine reducing the whole to a pasty mass which is finally stowed away in casks In this way they will keep almost any length of time without the fragrance being seriously injured A good rose-water can be prepared by distilling 12 lbs of pickled roses and 2-1/2 gallons of water Draw off two gallons; the product will be the double-distilled rose-water of the shops The rose-water that is imported from the South of France is however very superior in odor to any that can be produced here As it is a residuary product of the distillation of roses for procuring the attar it has a richness of aroma which appears to be inimitable with English-grown roses There are four modifications of essence of rose for the handkerchief which are the ne plus ultra of the perfumer's art They are—esprit de rose triple essence of white of roses essence of tea rose and essence of moss rose The following are the recipes for their formation:—",

"By distilling the Rosmarinus officinalis a thin limpid otto is procured having the characteristic odor of the plant which is more aromatic than sweet One cwt of the fresh herb yields about twenty-four ounces of oil Otto of rosemary is very extensively used in perfumery especially in combination with other ottos for scenting soap Eau de Cologne cannot be made without it and in the once famous Hungary water it is the leading ingredient The following is the composition of",

"It is put up for sale in a similar way to eau de Cologne and is said to take its name from one of the queens of Hungary who is reported to have derived great benefit from a bath containing it at the age of seventy-five years There is no doubt that clergymen and orators while speaking for any time would derive great benefit from perfuming their handkerchief with Hungary water or eau de Cologne as the rosemary they contain excites the mind to vigorous action sufficient of the stimulant being inhaled by occasionally wiping the face with the handkerchief wetted with these waters Shakspeare giving us the key we can understand how it is that such perfumes containing rosemary are universally said to be so refreshing!",
"Sage—A powerful-scenting otto can be procured by distillation from any of the Salvieæ. It is rarely used but is nevertheless very valuable in combination for scenting soap",

"This is an old favorite with the lovers of scent; it is the wood that possesses the odor The finest santal-wood grows in the island of Timor and the Santal-wood Islands where it is extensively cultivated for the Chinese market In the religious ceremonies of the Brahmins Hindoos and Chinese santal-wood is burned by way of incense to an extent almost beyond belief The Santala grew plentifully in China but the continued offerings to the Buddahs have almost exterminated the plant from the Celestial Empire; and such is the demand that it is about to be cultivated in Western Australia in the expectation of a profitable return which we doubt not will be realized; England alone would consume tenfold the quantity it does were its price within the range of other perfuming substances The otto which exists in the santal-wood is readily procured by distillation; 1 cwt of good wood will yield about 30 ounces of otto",
"Santal-wood Santal-wood",
"The white ant which is so common in India and China eating into every organic matter that it comes across appears to have no relish for santal-wood; hence it is frequently made into caskets jewel-boxes deed-cases &c This quality together with its fragrance renders it a valuable article to the cabinet-makers of the East",
"The otto of santal is remarkably dense and is above all others oleaginous in its appearance and when good is of a dark straw color When dissolved in spirit it enters into the composition of a great many of the old-fashioned bouquets such as Marechale and others the formulæ of which will be given hereafter Perfumers thus make what is called",
"Extrait de Bois de Santal",
"Rectified spirits  7 pints",
"Esprit de rose 1 pint",
"Essential oil ieotto of santal 3 oz",
"The odor of santal assimilates well with rose; and hence prior to the cultivation of rose-leaf geranium it was used to adulterate otto of roses; but is now but seldom used for that purpose",
"By a phonetic error santal is often printed sandal and sandel",
"Sassafras—Some of the perfumers of Germany use a tincture of the wood of the Laurus sassafras in the manufacture of hair-washes and other nostrums; but as in our opinion it has rather a physicky smell than flowery we cannot recommend the German recipes The Eau Athenienne notwithstanding has some reputation as a hair-water but is little else than a weak tincture of sassafras",
"Spike—French oil of lavender which is procured from the Lavandula spica is generally called oil of spike See Lavender",
"The power which these bodies have of fixing a volatile substance renders them valuable to the perfumer independent of their aroma which is due in many cases to benzoic acid slightly modified by an esential oil peculiar to each substance and which is taken up by the alcohol together with a portion of resin When the perfume is put upon a handkerchief the most volatile bodies disappear first: thus after the alcohol has evaporated the odor of the ottos appear stronger; if it contains any resinous body the ottos are held in solution as it were by the resin and thus retained on the fabric Supposing a perfume to be made of otto only without any fixing substance then as the perfume dies away the olfactory nerve if tutored will detect its composition for it spontaneously analyzes itself no two ottos having the same volatility: thus make a mixture of rose jasmine and patchouly; the jasmine predominates first then the rose and lastly the patchouly which will be found hours after the others have disappeared",
"Syringa—The flowers of the Philadelphus coronarius or common garden syringa have an intense odor resembling the orange-blossom; so much so that in America the plant is often termed mock orange A great deal of the pomatum sold as pommade surfin à la fleur d'orange by the manufacturers of Cannes is nothing more than fine suet perfumed with syringa blossoms by the maceration process Fine syringa pomade could be made in England at a quarter the cost of what is paid for the so-called orange pomatum",
"Thyme—All the different species of thyme but more particularly the lemon thyme the Thymus serpyllum as well as the marjorams origanum &c yield by distillation fragrant ottos that are extensively used by manufacturing perfumers for scenting soaps; though well adapted for this purpose they do not answer at all in any other combinations Both in grease and in spirit all these ottos impart an herby smell very naturally rather than a flowery one and as a consequence they are not considered recherché.",
"When any of these herbs are dried and ground they usefully enter into the composition of sachet powders",
"Tonquin or Tonka—The seeds of the Dipterix odorata are the tonquin or coumarouma beans of commerce When fresh they are exceedingly fragrant having an intense odor of newly made hay The Anthoxanthum odoratum or sweet-smelling vernal grass to which new hay owes its odor probably yields identically the same fragrant principle and it is remarkable that both tonquin beans and vernal grass while actually growing are nearly scentless but become rapidly aromatic when severed from the parent stock",
"Chemically considered tonquin beans are very interesting containing when fresh a fragrant volatile otto to which their odor is principally due, benzoic acid a fat oil and a neutral principal—Coumarin In perfumery they are valuable as when ground they form with other bodies an excellent and permanent sachet and by infusion in spirit the tincture or extract of tonquin enters into a thousand of the compound essences; but on account of its great strength it must be used with caution otherwise people say your perfume is snuffy owing to the predominance of the odor and its well-known use in the boxes of those who indulge in the titillating dust",
"If you have traveled although you will endeavor to improve your mind in such travel do not be constantly speaking of your journeyings Nothing is more tiresome than a man who commences every phrase with “When I was in Paris” or “In Italy I saw——.”",

"It is a somewhat ungrateful task to tell those who would shrink from the imputation of a falsehood that they are in the daily habit of uttering untruths; and yet if I proceed no other course than this can be taken by me It is of no use to adopt half measures; plain speaking saves a deal of trouble",

"CONTENTS 1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS TARGETS AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE",
"1. INTRODUCTION",
"The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage to outline its possible effects and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it",
"Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury detection and reprisal",
"A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage if any by highly indirect means It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions to adopt a noncooperative attitude and to induce others to follow suit Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one's fellow workers engaging in bickerings or displaying surliness and stupidity",
"2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS",
"Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe An effort should be made to add to their efficiency lessen their detectability and increase their number Acts of simple sabotage multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs can be an effective weapon against the enemy Slashing tires draining fuel tanks starting fires starting arguments acting stupidly short-circuiting electric systems abrading machine parts will waste materials manpower and time Occurring on a wide scale simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy",
"Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police Further success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions Finally the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation",
"3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR",
"To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem",
"(1) Personal Motives",
"c More important than a or b would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage",
"(2) Encouraging Destructiveness",
"d Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage Among the media which may be used as the immediate situation dictates are: freedom stations or radio false unreadable broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas or they may be general in scope Finally agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly",
"(3) Safety Measures",
"b It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons time and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation Among such suggestions might be the following:",
"(1) Use materials which appear to be innocent A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage Matches pebbles hair salt nails and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches hammers emery paper and the like",
"(2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible For instance if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box almost anyone could have done it On-the-street sabotage after dark such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you",
"(3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly so long as you do so rarely and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work Always be profuse in your apologies Frequently you can get away with such acts under the cover of pretending stupidity ignorance over-caution fear of being suspected of sabotage or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment",
"(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens Loiterers arouse suspicion Of course there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave If you commit sabotage on your job you should naturally stay at your work",
"4. TOOLS TARGETS AND TIMING",
"The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors moreover might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity",
"Sabotage suggestions of course should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press freedom stations and cooperating propaganda",
"(1) Under General Conditions",
"a Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief and it should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy",
"d The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use Without special knowledge however it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products",
"(2) Prior to a Military Offensive During periods which are quiescent in a military sense such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy Slashing a rubber tire on an Army truck may be an act of value; spoiling a batch of rubber in the production plant is an act of still more value",
"(3) During a Military Offensive",
"a Most significant sabotage for an area which is or is soon destined to be a theater of combat operations is that whose effects will be direct and immediate Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects while widespread are indirect and delayed",
"(1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds",
"Among such facilities are roads railroads auto mobiles trucks motor-cycles bicycles trains and trams",
"(2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage These include telephone telegraph and power systems radio newspapers placards and public notices",
"(3) Critical materials valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning of transportation and communication also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur These may include oil gasoline tires food and water",
"5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE",
"It will not be possible to evaluate the desirability of simple sabotage in an area without having in mind rather specifically what individual acts and results are embraced by the definition of simple sabotage",
"A listing of specific acts follows classified according to types of target This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage As new techniques are developed or new fields explored it will be elaborated and expanded",
"(1) Buildings",
"Warehouses barracks offices hotels and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage They are extremely susceptible to damage especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors charwomen and casual visitors; and when damaged they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy",
"a Fires can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone",
"(1) Whenever possible arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away Use a candle and paper combination setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper The size heat and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space",
"(2) With a flame of this kind do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials such as cotton sacking To light more resistant materials use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline To create a briefer but even hotter flame put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle",
"(3) To make another type of simple fuse soak one end of a piece of string in grease Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string Then ignite the clean end of the string It will burn slowly without a flame in much the same way that a cigarette burns until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder Run the string over the match heads taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted They too will produce a sudden flame The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose",
"(4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy",
"(5) In basements where waste is kept janitors should accumulate oily and greasy waste Such waste sometimes ignites spontaneously but it can easily be lit with a cigarette or match If you are a janitor on night duty you can be the first to report the fire but don't report it too soon",
"(6) A clean factory is not susceptible to fire but a dirty one is Workers should be careless with refuse and janitors should be inefficient in cleaning If enough dirt and trash can be accumulated an otherwise fireproof building will become inflammable",
"(7) Where illuminating gas is used in a room which is vacant at night shut the windows tightly turn on the gas and leave a candle burning in the room closing the door tightly behind you After a time the gas will explode and a fire may or may not follow",
"b Water and miscellaneous",
"(1) Ruin warehouse stock by setting the automatic sprinkler system to work You can do this by tapping the sprinkler heads sharply with a hammer or by holding a match under them",
"(2) Forget to provide paper in toilets; put tightly rolled paper hair and other obstructions in the W C Saturate a sponge with a thick starch or sugar solution Squeeze it tightly into a ball wrap it with string and dry Remove the string when fully dried The sponge will be in the form of a tight hard ball Flush down a",
"W C or otherwise introduce into a sewer line The sponge will gradually expand to its normal size and plug the sewage system",
"(3) Put a coin beneath a bulb in a public building during the daytime so that fuses will blow out when lights are turned on at night The fuses themselves may be rendered ineffective by putting a coin behind them or loading them with heavy wire Then a short-circuit may either start a fire damage transformers or blow out a central fuse which will interrupt distribution of electricity to a large area",
"(4) Jam paper bits of wood hairpins and anything else that will fit into the locks of all unguarded entrances to public buildings",
"(2) Industrial Production: Manufacturing",
"a Tools",
"(1) Let cutting tools grow dull They will be inefficient will slow down production and may damage the materials and parts you use them on",
"(2) Leave saws slightly twisted when you are not using them After a while they will break when used",
"(3) Using a very rapid stroke will wear out a file before its time So will dragging a file in slow strokes under heavy pressure Exert pressure on the backward stroke as well as the forward stroke",
"(4) Clean files by knocking them against the vise or the workpiece; they are easily broken this way",
"(5) Bits and drills will snap under heavy pressure",
"(6) You can put a press punch out of order by putting in it more material than it is adjusted for—two blanks instead of one for example",
"(7) Power-driven tools like pneumatic drills riveters and so on are never efficient when dirty Lubrication points and electric contacts can easily be fouled by normal accumulations of dirt or the insertion of foreign matter",
"b Oil and lubrication systems are not only vulnerable to easy sabotage but are critical in every machine with moving parts Sabotage of oil and lubrication will slow production or stop work entirely at strategic points in industrial processes",
"(1) Put metal dust or filings fine sand ground glass emery dust get it by pounding up an emery knife sharpener and similar hard gritty substances directly into lubrication systems They will scour smooth surfaces ruining pistons cylinder walls shafts and bearings They will overheat and stop motors which will need overhauling new parts and extensive repairs Such materials if they are used should be introduced into lubrication systems past any filters which otherwise would strain them out",
"(2) You can cause wear on any machine by uncovering a filter system poking a pencil or any other sharp object through the filter mesh then covering it up again Or if you can dispose of it quickly simply remove the filter",
"(3) If you cannot get at the lubrication system or filter directly you may be able to lessen the effectiveness of oil by diluting it in storage In this case almost any liquid will do which will thin the oil A small amount of sulphuric acid varnish water-glass or linseed oil will be especially effective",
"(4) Using a thin oil where a heavy oil is prescribed will break down a machine or heat up a moving shaft so that it will freeze and stop",
"(5) Put any clogging substance into lubrication systems or if it will float into stored oil Twisted combings of human hair pieces of string dead insects and many other common objects will be effective in stopping or hindering the flow of oil through feed lines and filters",
"(6) Under some circumstances you may be able to destroy oil outright rather than interfere with its effectiveness by removing stop-plugs from lubricating systems or by puncturing the drums and cans in which it is stored",
"c Cooling Systems (1.) A water cooling system can be put out of commission in a fairly short time with considerable damage to an engine or motor if you put into it several pinches of hard grain such as rice or wheat They will swell up and choke the circulation of water and the cooling system will have to be torn down to remove the obstruction Sawdust or hair may also be used to clog a water cooling system",
"(2) If very cold water is quickly introduced into the cooling system of an overheated motor contraction and considerable strain on the engine housing will result If you can repeat the treatment a few times cracking and serious damage will result",
"(3) You can ruin the effectiveness of an air cooling system by plugging dirt and waste into intake or exhaust valves If a belt-run fan is used in the system make a jagged cut at least half way through the belt; it will slip and finally part under strain and the motor will overheat",
"d Gasoline and Oil Fuel Tanks and fueling engines usually are accessible and easy to open They afford a very vulnerable target for simple sabotage activities (1.) Put several pinches of sawdust or hard grain such as rice or wheat into the fuel tank of a gasoline engine The particles will choke a feed line so that the engine will stop Some time will be required to discover the source of the trouble Although they will be hard to get crumbs of natural rubber such as you might find in old rubber bands and pencil erasers are also effective",
"(2) If you can accumulate sugar put it in the fuel tank of a gasoline engine As it burns together with the gasoline it will turn into a sticky mess which will completely mire the engine and necessitate extensive cleaning and repair Honey and molasses are as good as sugar Try to use about 75-100 grams for each 10 gallons of gasoline",
"(3) Other impurities which you can introduce into gasoline will cause rapid engine wear and eventual breakdown Fine particles of pumice sand ground glass and metal dust can easily be introduced into a gasoline tank Be sure that the particles are very fine so that they will be able to pass through the carburetor jet",
"(4) Water urine wine or any other simple liquid you can get in reasonably large quantities will dilute gasoline fuel to a point where no combustion will occur in the cylinder and the engine will not move One pint to 20 gallons of gasoline is sufficient If salt water is used it will cause corrosion and permanent motor damage",
"(5) In the case of Diesel engines put low flashpoint oil into the fuel tank; the engine will not move If there already is proper oil in the tank when the wrong kind is added the engine will only limp and sputter along",
"(6) Fuel lines to gasoline and oil engines frequently pass over the exhaust pipe When the machine is at rest you can stab a small hole in the fuel line and plug the hole with wax As the engine runs and the exhaust tube becomes hot the wax will be melted; fuel will drip onto the exhaust and a blaze will start",
"(7) If you have access to a room where gasoline is stored remember that gas vapor accumulating in a closed room will explode after a time if you leave a candle burning in the room A good deal of evaporation however must occur from the gasoline tins into the air of the room If removal of the tops of the tins does not expose enough gasoline to the air to ensure copious evaporation you can open lightly constructed tins further with a knife ice pick or sharpened nail file Or puncture a tiny hole in the tank which will permit gasoline to leak out on the floor This will greatly increase the rate of evaporation Before you light your candle be sure that windows are closed and the room is as air-tight as you can make it If you can see that windows in a neighboring room are opened wide you have a chance of setting a large fire which will not only destroy the gasoline but anything else nearby; when the gasoline explodes the doors of the storage room will be blown open a draft to the neighboring windows will be created which will whip up a fine conflagration",
"e Electric Motors Electric motors including dynamos are more restricted than the targets so far discussed They cannot be sabotaged easily or without risk of injury by unskilled persons who may otherwise have good opportunities for destruction",
"(1) Set the rheostat to a high point of resistance in all types of electric motors They will overheat and catch fire",
"(2) Adjust the overload relay to a very high value beyond the capacity of the motor Then overload the motor to a point where it will overheat and break down",
"(3) Remember that dust dirt and moisture are enemies of electrical equipment Spill dust and dirt onto the points where the wires in electric motors connect with terminals and onto insulating parts Inefficient transmission of current and in some cases short circuits will result Wet generator motors to produce short circuits",
"(4) Accidentally bruise the insulation on wire loosen nuts on connections make faulty splices and faulty connections in wiring to waste electric current and reduce the power of electric motors the power output or cause short circuiting in direct-current motors: Loosen or remove commutator holding rings Sprinkle carbon graphite or metal dust on commutators Put a little grease or oil at the contact points of commutators Where commutator bars are close together bridge the gaps between them with metal dust or sawtooth their edges with a chisel so that the teeth on adjoining bars meet or nearly meet and current can pass from one to the other",
"(6) Put a piece of finely grained emery paper half the size of a postage stamp in a place where it will wear away rotating brushes The emery paper and the motor will be destroyed in the resulting fire",
"(7) Sprinkle carbon graphite or metal dust on slip-rings so that the current will leak or short circuits will occur When a motor is idle nick the slip-rings with a chisel",
"(8) Cause motor stoppage or inefficiency by applying dust mixed with grease to the face of the armature so that it will not make proper contact",
"(9) To overheat electric motors mix sand with heavy grease and smear it between the stator and rotor or wedge thin metal pieces between them To prevent the efficient generation of current put floor sweepings oil tar or paint between them",
"(10) In motors using three-phase current deeply nick one of the lead-in wires with a knife or file when the machine is at rest or replace one of the three fuses with a blown-out fuse In the first case the motor will stop after running awhile and in the second it will not start",
"f Transformers",
"(1) Transformers of the oil-filled type can be put out of commission if you pour water salt into the oil tank",
"(2) In air-cooled transformers block the ventilation by piling debris around the transformer",
"(3) In all types of transformers throw carbon graphite or metal dust over the outside bushings and other exposed electrical parts",
"g Turbines for the most part are heavily built stoutly housed and difficult of access Their vulnerability to simple sabotage is very low",
"(1) After inspecting or repairing a hydro turbine fasten the cover insecurely so that it will blow off and flood the plant with water A loose cover on a steam turbine will cause it to leak and slow down",
"(2) In water turbines insert a large piece of scrap iron in the head of the penstock just beyond the screening so that water will carry the damaging material down to the plant equipment",
"(3) When the steam line to a turbine is opened for repair put pieces of scrap iron into it to be blasted into the turbine machinery when steam is up again",
"(4) Create a leak in the line feeding oil to the turbine so that oil will fall on the hot steam pipe and cause a fire",
"h Boilers",
"(1) Reduce the efficiency of steam boilers any way you can Put too much water in them to make them slow-starting or keep the fire under them low to keep them inefficient Let them dry and turn the fire up; they will crack and be ruined An especially good trick is to keep putting limestone or water containing lime in the boiler; it will deposit lime on the bottom and sides This deposit will provide very good insulation against heat; after enough of it has collected the boiler will be completely worthless",
"(3) Production Metals",
"a Iron and Steel",
"(1) Keep blast furnaces in a condition where they must be frequently shut down for repair In making fire-proof bricks for the inner lining of blast furnaces put in an extra proportion of tar so that they will wear out quickly and necessitate constant re-lining",
"(2) Make cores for casting so that they are filled with air bubbles and an imperfect cast results",
"(3) See that the core in a mold is not properly supported so that the core gives way or the casting is spoiled because of the incorrect position of the core",
"(4) In tempering steel or iron apply too much heat so that the resulting bars and ingots are of poor quality",
"b Other Metals",
"No suggestions available",
"(4) Production: Mining and Mineral Extraction",
"a Coal",
"(1) A slight blow against your Davy oil lamp will extinguish it and to light it again you will have to find a place where there is no fire damp Take a long time looking for the place",
"(2) Blacksmiths who make pneumatic picks should not harden them properly so that they will quickly grow dull",
"(3) You can easily put your pneumatic pick out of order Pour a small amount of water through the oil lever and your pick will stop working Coal dust and improper lubrication will also put it out of order",
"(4) Weaken the chain that pulls the bucket conveyers carrying coal A deep dent in the chain made with blows of a pick or shovel will cause it to part under normal strain Once a chain breaks normally or otherwise take your time about reporting the damage; be slow about taking the chain up for repairs and bringing it back down after repairs",
"(5) Derail mine cars by putting obstructions on the rails and in switch points If possible pick a gallery where coal cars have to pass each other so that traffic will be snarled up",
"(6) Send up quantities of rock and other useless material with the coal",
"(5) Production: Agriculture",
"a Machinery",
"(1) See par 5 b (2) c, d, e.",
"b Crops and livestock probably will be destroyed only in areas where there are large food surpluses or where the enemy regime is known to be requisitioning food",
"(1.) Feed crops to livestock Let crops harvest too early or too late Spoil stores of grain fruit and vegetables by soaking them in water so that they will rot Spoil fruit and vegetables by leaving them in the sun",
"(6) Transportation: Railways",
"a Passengers",
"(1.) Make train travel as inconvenient as possible for enemy personnel Make mistakes in issuing train tickets leaving portions of the journey uncovered by the ticket book; issue two tickets for the same seat in the train so that an interesting argument will result; near train time instead of issuing printed tickets write them out slowly by hand prolonging the process until the train is nearly ready to leave or has left the station On station bulletin boards announcing train arrivals and departures see that false and misleading information is given about trains bound for enemy destinations",
"(2) In trains bound for enemy destinations attendants should make life as uncomfortable as possible for passengers See that the food is especially bad take up tickets after midnight call all station stops very loudly during the night handle baggage as noisily as possible during the night and so on",
"(3) See that the luggage of enemy personnel is mislaid or unloaded at the wrong stations",
"Switch address labels on enemy baggage",
"(4) Engineers should see that trains run slow or make unscheduled stops for plausible reasons",
"b Switches Signals and Routing",
"(1) Exchange wires in switchboards containing signals and switches so that they connect to the wrong terminals",
"(2) Loosen push-rods so that signal arms do not work; break signal lights; exchange the colored lenses on red and green lights",
"(3) Spread and spike switch points in the track so that they will not move or place rocks or close-packed dirt between the switch points",
"(4) Sprinkle rock salt or ordinary salt profusely over the electrical connections of switch points and on the ground nearby When it rains the switch will be short-circuited",
"(5) See that cars are put on the wrong trains Remove the labels from cars needing repair and put them on cars in good order Leave couplings between cars as loose as possible",
"c Road-beds and Open Track",
"(1) On a curve take the bolts out of the tie-plates connecting to sections of the outside rail and scoop away the gravel cinders or dirt for a few feet on each side of the connecting joint",
"(2) If by disconnecting the tie-plate at a joint and loosening sleeper nails on each side of the joint it becomes possible to move a sections of rail spread two sections of rail and drive a spike vertically between them",
"d Oil and Lubrication",
"(1) See 5 b (2) b.",
"(2) Squeeze lubricating pipes with pincers or dent them with hammers so that the flow of oil is obstructed",
"e Cooling Systems",

"f Gasoline and Oil Fuel",
"(1) See 5 b (2) d.",
"g Electric Motors",
"(1) See 5 b (2) e and f.",
"h Boilers",
"(1) See 5 b (2) h.",
"(2) After inspection put heavy oil or tar in the engines' boilers or put half a kilogram of soft soap into the water in the tender",
"i Brakes and Miscellaneous",
"(1) Engines should run at high speeds and use brakes excessively at curves and on downhill grades",
"(2) Punch holes in air-brake valves or water supply pipes",
"(3) In the last car of a passenger train or or a front car of a freight remove the wadding from a journal box and replace it with oily rags",
"(7) Transportation: Automotive",
"a Roads Damage to roads [(3) below] is slow and therefore impractical as a D-day or near D-day activity",
"In areas where traffic is composed primarily of enemy autos trucks and motor convoys of various kinds remove danger signals from curves and intersections",
"(2) When the enemy asks for directions give him wrong information Especially when enemy convoys are in the neighborhood truck drivers can spread rumors and give false information about bridges being out ferries closed and detours lying ahead",
"(3) If you can start damage to a heavily traveled road passing traffic and the elements will do the rest Construction gangs can see that too much sand or water is put in concrete or that the road foundation has soft spots Anyone can scoop ruts in asphalt and macadam roads which turn soft in hot weather; passing trucks will accentuate the ruts to a point where substantial repair will be needed Dirt roads also can be scooped out If you are a road laborer it will be only a few minutes work to divert a small stream from a sluice so that it runs over and eats away the road",
"(4) Distribute broken glass nails and sharp rocks on roads to puncture tires",
"b Passengers",
"c Oil and Lubrication",
"(1) See 5 b (2) b.",
"(2) Disconnect the oil pump; this will burn out the main bearings in less than 50 miles of normal driving",
"d Radiator",
"(1) See 5 b (2) c.",
"e Fuel",
"(1) See 5 b (2) d.",
"f Battery and Ignition",
"(1) Jam bits of wood into the ignition lock; loosen or exchange connections behind the switchboard; put dirt in spark plugs; damage distributor points",
"(2) Turn on the lights in parked cars so that the battery will run down",
"(3) Mechanics can ruin batteries in a number of undetectable ways: Take the valve cap off a cell and drive a screw driver slantwise into the exposed water vent shattering the plates of the cell; no damage will show when you put the cap back on Iron or copper filings put into the cells ie dropped into the acid will greatly shorten its life Copper coins or a few pieces of iron will accomplish the same and more slowly",
"One hundred to 150 cubic centimeters of vinegar in each cell greatly reduces the life of the battery but the odor of the vinegar may reveal what has happened",
"g Gears",
"(1) Remove the lubricant from or put too light a lubricant in the transmission and other gears",
"(2) In trucks tractors and other machines with heavy gears fix the gear case insecurely putting bolts in only half the bolt holes The gears will be badly jolted in use and will soon need repairs",
"h Tires",
"(1) Slash or puncture tires of unguarded vehicles Put a nail inside a match box or other small box and set it vertically in front of the back tire of a stationary car; when the car starts off the nail will go neatly through the tire",
"(2) It is easy to damage a tire in a tire repair shop: In fixing flats spill glass benzine caustic soda or other material inside the casing which will puncture or corrode the tube If you put a gummy substance inside the tube the next flat will stick the tube to the casing and make it unusable Or when you fix a flat tire you can simply leave between the tube and the casing the object which caused the flat in the first place",
"(3) In assembling a tire after repair pump the tube up as fast as you can Instead of filling out smoothly it may crease in which case it will wear out quickly Or as you put a tire together see if you can pinch the tube between the rim of the tire and the rim of the wheel so that a blow-out will result",
"(4) In putting air into tires see that they are kept below normal pressure so that more than an ordinary amount of wear will result In filling tires on double wheels inflate the inner tire to a much higher pressure than the outer one; both will wear out more quickly this way Badly aligned wheels also wear tires out quickly; you can leave wheels out of alignment when they come in for adjustment or you can spring them out of true with a strong kick or by driving the car slowly and diagonally into a curb",
"(5) If you have access to stocks of tires you can rot them by spilling oil gasoline caustic acid or benzine on them Synthetic rubber however is less susceptible to these chemicals",
"(8) Transportation: Water",
"a Navigation",
"(1) Barge and river boat personnel should spread false rumors about the navigability and conditions of the waterways they travel Tell other barge and boat captains to follow channels that will take extra time or cause them to make canal detours",
"(2) Barge and river boat captains should navigate with exceeding caution near locks and bridges to waste their time and to waste the time of other craft which may have to wait on them If you don't pump the bilges of ships and barges often enough they will be slower and harder to navigate Barges accidentally run aground are an efficient time waster too",
"(3) Attendants on swing draw or bascule bridges can delay traffic over the bridge or in the waterway underneath by being slow Boat captains can leave unattended draw bridges open in order to hold up road traffic",
"(4) Add or subtract compensating magnets to the compass on cargo ships Demagnetize the compass or maladjust it by concealing a large bar of steel or iron near to it",
"b Cargo",
"(1) While loading or unloading handle cargo carelessly in order to cause damage Arrange the cargo so that the weakest and lightest crates and boxes will be at the bottom of the hold while the heaviest ones are on top of them",
"Put hatch covers and tarpaulins on sloppily so that rain and deck wash will injure the cargo",
"Tie float valves open so that storage tanks will overflow on perishable goods",
"(9) Communications",
"a Telephone",
"(1) At office hotel and exchange switch boards delay putting enemy calls through give them wrong numbers cut them off accidentally or forget to disconnect them so that the line cannot be used again",
"(2) Hamper official and especially military business by making at least one telephone call a day to an enemy headquarters; when you get them tell them you have the wrong number",
"Call military or police offices and make anonymous false reports of fires air raids bombs",
"(3) In offices and buildings used by the enemy unscrew the earphone of telephone receivers and remove the diaphragm Electricians and telephone repair men can make poor connections and damage insulation so that cross talk and other kinds of electrical interference will make conversations hard or impossible to understand",
"(4) Put the batteries under automatic switchboards out of commission by dropping nails metal filings or coins into the cells If you can treat half the batteries in this way the switchboard will stop working A whole telephone system can be disrupted if you can put 10 percent of the cells in half the batteries of the central battery room out of order",
"b Telegraph",
"(1) Delay the transmission and delivery of telegrams to enemy destinations",
"(2) Garble telegrams to enemy destinations so that another telegram will have to be sent or a long distance call will have to be made Sometimes it will be possible to do this by changing a single letter in a word — for example changing minimum to maximum so that the person receiving the telegram will not know whether minimum or maximum is meant",
"c Transportation Lines",
"(1) Cut telephone and telegraph transmission lines Damage insulation on power lines to cause interference",
"d Mail",
"(1) Post office employees can see to it that enemy mail is always delayed by one day or more that it is put in wrong sacks and so on",
"e Motion Pictures",
"(1) Projector operators can ruin newsreels and other enemy propaganda films by bad focusing speeding up or slowing down the film and by causing frequent breakage in the film",
"(2) Audiences can ruin enemy propaganda films by applauding to drown the words of the speaker by coughing loudly and by talking",
"(3) Anyone can break up a showing of an enemy propaganda film by putting two or three dozen large moths in a paper bag Take the bag to the movies with you put it on the floor in an empty section of the theater as you go in and leave it open The moths will fly out and climb into the projector beam so that the film will be obscured by fluttering shadows",

"CONTENTS 1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS TARGETS AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE",
"1. INTRODUCTION",
"The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage to outline its possible effects and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it",
"Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury detection and reprisal",
"A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage if any by highly indirect means It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions to adopt a noncooperative attitude and to induce others to follow suit Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one's fellow workers engaging in bickerings or displaying surliness and stupidity",
"2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS",
"Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe An effort should be made to add to their efficiency lessen their detectability and increase their number Acts of simple sabotage multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs can be an effective weapon against the enemy Slashing tires draining fuel tanks starting fires starting arguments acting stupidly short-circuiting electric systems abrading machine parts will waste materials manpower and time Occurring on a wide scale simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy",
"Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police Further success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions Finally the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation",
"3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR",
"To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem",
"(1) Personal Motives",
"c More important than a or b would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage",
"(2) Encouraging Destructiveness",
"d Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage Among the media which may be used as the immediate situation dictates are: freedom stations or radio false unreadable broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas or they may be general in scope Finally agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly",
"(3) Safety Measures",
"b It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons time and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation Among such suggestions might be the following:",
"(1) Use materials which appear to be innocent A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage Matches pebbles hair salt nails and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches hammers emery paper and the like",
"(2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible For instance if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box almost anyone could have done it On-the-street sabotage after dark such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you",
"(3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly so long as you do so rarely and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work Always be profuse in your apologies Frequently you can get away with such acts under the cover of pretending stupidity ignorance over-caution fear of being suspected of sabotage or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment",
"(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens Loiterers arouse suspicion Of course there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave If you commit sabotage on your job you should naturally stay at your work",
"4. TOOLS TARGETS AND TIMING",
"The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors moreover might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity",
"Sabotage suggestions of course should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press freedom stations and cooperating propaganda",
"(1) Under General Conditions",
"a Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief and it should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy",
"d The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use Without special knowledge however it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products",
"(2) Prior to a Military Offensive During periods which are quiescent in a military sense such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy Slashing a rubber tire on an Army truck may be an act of value; spoiling a batch of rubber in the production plant is an act of still more value",
"(3) During a Military Offensive",
"a Most significant sabotage for an area which is or is soon destined to be a theater of combat operations is that whose effects will be direct and immediate Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects while widespread are indirect and delayed",
"(1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds",
"Among such facilities are roads railroads auto mobiles trucks motor-cycles bicycles trains and trams",
"(2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage These include telephone telegraph and power systems radio newspapers placards and public notices",
"(3) Critical materials valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning of transportation and communication also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur These may include oil gasoline tires food and water",
"5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE",
"It will not be possible to evaluate the desirability of simple sabotage in an area without having in mind rather specifically what individual acts and results are embraced by the definition of simple sabotage",
"A listing of specific acts follows classified according to types of target This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage As new techniques are developed or new fields explored it will be elaborated and expanded",
"(1) Buildings",
"Warehouses barracks offices hotels and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage They are extremely susceptible to damage especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors charwomen and casual visitors; and when damaged they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy",
"a Fires can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone",
"(1) Whenever possible arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away Use a candle and paper combination setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper The size heat and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space",
"(2) With a flame of this kind do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials such as cotton sacking To light more resistant materials use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline To create a briefer but even hotter flame put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle",
"(3) To make another type of simple fuse soak one end of a piece of string in grease Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string Then ignite the clean end of the string It will burn slowly without a flame in much the same way that a cigarette burns until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder Run the string over the match heads taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted They too will produce a sudden flame The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose",
"(4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy",
"(5) In basements where waste is kept janitors should accumulate oily and greasy waste Such waste sometimes ignites spontaneously but it can easily be lit with a cigarette or match If you are a janitor on night duty you can be the first to report the fire but don't report it too soon",
"(6) A clean factory is not susceptible to fire but a dirty one is Workers should be careless with refuse and janitors should be inefficient in cleaning If enough dirt and trash can be accumulated an otherwise fireproof building will become inflammable",
"(7) Where illuminating gas is used in a room which is vacant at night shut the windows tightly turn on the gas and leave a candle burning in the room closing the door tightly behind you After a time the gas will explode and a fire may or may not follow",
"b Water and miscellaneous",
"(1) Ruin warehouse stock by setting the automatic sprinkler system to work You can do this by tapping the sprinkler heads sharply with a hammer or by holding a match under them",
"(2) Forget to provide paper in toilets; put tightly rolled paper hair and other obstructions in the W C Saturate a sponge with a thick starch or sugar solution Squeeze it tightly into a ball wrap it with string and dry Remove the string when fully dried The sponge will be in the form of a tight hard ball Flush down a",
"W C or otherwise introduce into a sewer line The sponge will gradually expand to its normal size and plug the sewage system",
"(3) Put a coin beneath a bulb in a public building during the daytime so that fuses will blow out when lights are turned on at night The fuses themselves may be rendered ineffective by putting a coin behind them or loading them with heavy wire Then a short-circuit may either start a fire damage transformers or blow out a central fuse which will interrupt distribution of electricity to a large area",
"(4) Jam paper bits of wood hairpins and anything else that will fit into the locks of all unguarded entrances to public buildings",
"(2) Industrial Production: Manufacturing",
"a Tools",
"(1) Let cutting tools grow dull They will be inefficient will slow down production and may damage the materials and parts you use them on",
"(2) Leave saws slightly twisted when you are not using them After a while they will break when used",
"(3) Using a very rapid stroke will wear out a file before its time So will dragging a file in slow strokes under heavy pressure Exert pressure on the backward stroke as well as the forward stroke",
"(4) Clean files by knocking them against the vise or the workpiece; they are easily broken this way",
"(5) Bits and drills will snap under heavy pressure",
"(6) You can put a press punch out of order by putting in it more material than it is adjusted for—two blanks instead of one for example",
"(7) Power-driven tools like pneumatic drills riveters and so on are never efficient when dirty Lubrication points and electric contacts can easily be fouled by normal accumulations of dirt or the insertion of foreign matter",
"b Oil and lubrication systems are not only vulnerable to easy sabotage but are critical in every machine with moving parts Sabotage of oil and lubrication will slow production or stop work entirely at strategic points in industrial processes",
"(1) Put metal dust or filings fine sand ground glass emery dust get it by pounding up an emery knife sharpener and similar hard gritty substances directly into lubrication systems They will scour smooth surfaces ruining pistons cylinder walls shafts and bearings They will overheat and stop motors which will need overhauling new parts and extensive repairs Such materials if they are used should be introduced into lubrication systems past any filters which otherwise would strain them out",
"(2) You can cause wear on any machine by uncovering a filter system poking a pencil or any other sharp object through the filter mesh then covering it up again Or if you can dispose of it quickly simply remove the filter",
"(3) If you cannot get at the lubrication system or filter directly you may be able to lessen the effectiveness of oil by diluting it in storage In this case almost any liquid will do which will thin the oil A small amount of sulphuric acid varnish water-glass or linseed oil will be especially effective",
"(4) Using a thin oil where a heavy oil is prescribed will break down a machine or heat up a moving shaft so that it will freeze and stop",
"(5) Put any clogging substance into lubrication systems or if it will float into stored oil Twisted combings of human hair pieces of string dead insects and many other common objects will be effective in stopping or hindering the flow of oil through feed lines and filters",
"(6) Under some circumstances you may be able to destroy oil outright rather than interfere with its effectiveness by removing stop-plugs from lubricating systems or by puncturing the drums and cans in which it is stored",
"c Cooling Systems (1.) A water cooling system can be put out of commission in a fairly short time with considerable damage to an engine or motor if you put into it several pinches of hard grain such as rice or wheat They will swell up and choke the circulation of water and the cooling system will have to be torn down to remove the obstruction Sawdust or hair may also be used to clog a water cooling system",
"(2) If very cold water is quickly introduced into the cooling system of an overheated motor contraction and considerable strain on the engine housing will result If you can repeat the treatment a few times cracking and serious damage will result",
"(3) You can ruin the effectiveness of an air cooling system by plugging dirt and waste into intake or exhaust valves If a belt-run fan is used in the system make a jagged cut at least half way through the belt; it will slip and finally part under strain and the motor will overheat",
"d Gasoline and Oil Fuel Tanks and fueling engines usually are accessible and easy to open They afford a very vulnerable target for simple sabotage activities (1.) Put several pinches of sawdust or hard grain such as rice or wheat into the fuel tank of a gasoline engine The particles will choke a feed line so that the engine will stop Some time will be required to discover the source of the trouble Although they will be hard to get crumbs of natural rubber such as you might find in old rubber bands and pencil erasers are also effective",
"(2) If you can accumulate sugar put it in the fuel tank of a gasoline engine As it burns together with the gasoline it will turn into a sticky mess which will completely mire the engine and necessitate extensive cleaning and repair Honey and molasses are as good as sugar Try to use about 75-100 grams for each 10 gallons of gasoline",
"(3) Other impurities which you can introduce into gasoline will cause rapid engine wear and eventual breakdown Fine particles of pumice sand ground glass and metal dust can easily be introduced into a gasoline tank Be sure that the particles are very fine so that they will be able to pass through the carburetor jet",
"(4) Water urine wine or any other simple liquid you can get in reasonably large quantities will dilute gasoline fuel to a point where no combustion will occur in the cylinder and the engine will not move One pint to 20 gallons of gasoline is sufficient If salt water is used it will cause corrosion and permanent motor damage",
"(5) In the case of Diesel engines put low flashpoint oil into the fuel tank; the engine will not move If there already is proper oil in the tank when the wrong kind is added the engine will only limp and sputter along",
"(6) Fuel lines to gasoline and oil engines frequently pass over the exhaust pipe When the machine is at rest you can stab a small hole in the fuel line and plug the hole with wax As the engine runs and the exhaust tube becomes hot the wax will be melted; fuel will drip onto the exhaust and a blaze will start",
"(7) If you have access to a room where gasoline is stored remember that gas vapor accumulating in a closed room will explode after a time if you leave a candle burning in the room A good deal of evaporation however must occur from the gasoline tins into the air of the room If removal of the tops of the tins does not expose enough gasoline to the air to ensure copious evaporation you can open lightly constructed tins further with a knife ice pick or sharpened nail file Or puncture a tiny hole in the tank which will permit gasoline to leak out on the floor This will greatly increase the rate of evaporation Before you light your candle be sure that windows are closed and the room is as air-tight as you can make it If you can see that windows in a neighboring room are opened wide you have a chance of setting a large fire which will not only destroy the gasoline but anything else nearby; when the gasoline explodes the doors of the storage room will be blown open a draft to the neighboring windows will be created which will whip up a fine conflagration",
"e Electric Motors Electric motors including dynamos are more restricted than the targets so far discussed They cannot be sabotaged easily or without risk of injury by unskilled persons who may otherwise have good opportunities for destruction",
"(1) Set the rheostat to a high point of resistance in all types of electric motors They will overheat and catch fire",
"(2) Adjust the overload relay to a very high value beyond the capacity of the motor Then overload the motor to a point where it will overheat and break down",
"(3) Remember that dust dirt and moisture are enemies of electrical equipment Spill dust and dirt onto the points where the wires in electric motors connect with terminals and onto insulating parts Inefficient transmission of current and in some cases short circuits will result Wet generator motors to produce short circuits",
"(4) Accidentally bruise the insulation on wire loosen nuts on connections make faulty splices and faulty connections in wiring to waste electric current and reduce the power of electric motors the power output or cause short circuiting in direct-current motors: Loosen or remove commutator holding rings Sprinkle carbon graphite or metal dust on commutators Put a little grease or oil at the contact points of commutators Where commutator bars are close together bridge the gaps between them with metal dust or sawtooth their edges with a chisel so that the teeth on adjoining bars meet or nearly meet and current can pass from one to the other",
"(6) Put a piece of finely grained emery paper half the size of a postage stamp in a place where it will wear away rotating brushes The emery paper and the motor will be destroyed in the resulting fire",
"(7) Sprinkle carbon graphite or metal dust on slip-rings so that the current will leak or short circuits will occur When a motor is idle nick the slip-rings with a chisel",
"(8) Cause motor stoppage or inefficiency by applying dust mixed with grease to the face of the armature so that it will not make proper contact",
"(9) To overheat electric motors mix sand with heavy grease and smear it between the stator and rotor or wedge thin metal pieces between them To prevent the efficient generation of current put floor sweepings oil tar or paint between them",
"(10) In motors using three-phase current deeply nick one of the lead-in wires with a knife or file when the machine is at rest or replace one of the three fuses with a blown-out fuse In the first case the motor will stop after running awhile and in the second it will not start",
"f Transformers",
"(1) Transformers of the oil-filled type can be put out of commission if you pour water salt into the oil tank",
"(2) In air-cooled transformers block the ventilation by piling debris around the transformer",
"(3) In all types of transformers throw carbon graphite or metal dust over the outside bushings and other exposed electrical parts",
"g Turbines for the most part are heavily built stoutly housed and difficult of access Their vulnerability to simple sabotage is very low",
"(1) After inspecting or repairing a hydro turbine fasten the cover insecurely so that it will blow off and flood the plant with water A loose cover on a steam turbine will cause it to leak and slow down",
"(2) In water turbines insert a large piece of scrap iron in the head of the penstock just beyond the screening so that water will carry the damaging material down to the plant equipment",
"(3) When the steam line to a turbine is opened for repair put pieces of scrap iron into it to be blasted into the turbine machinery when steam is up again",
"(4) Create a leak in the line feeding oil to the turbine so that oil will fall on the hot steam pipe and cause a fire",
"h Boilers",
"(1) Reduce the efficiency of steam boilers any way you can Put too much water in them to make them slow-starting or keep the fire under them low to keep them inefficient Let them dry and turn the fire up; they will crack and be ruined An especially good trick is to keep putting limestone or water containing lime in the boiler; it will deposit lime on the bottom and sides This deposit will provide very good insulation against heat; after enough of it has collected the boiler will be completely worthless",
"(3) Production Metals",
"a Iron and Steel",
"(1) Keep blast furnaces in a condition where they must be frequently shut down for repair In making fire-proof bricks for the inner lining of blast furnaces put in an extra proportion of tar so that they will wear out quickly and necessitate constant re-lining",
"(2) Make cores for casting so that they are filled with air bubbles and an imperfect cast results",
"(3) See that the core in a mold is not properly supported so that the core gives way or the casting is spoiled because of the incorrect position of the core",
"(4) In tempering steel or iron apply too much heat so that the resulting bars and ingots are of poor quality",
"b Other Metals",
"No suggestions available",
"(4) Production: Mining and Mineral Extraction",
"a Coal",
"(1) A slight blow against your Davy oil lamp will extinguish it and to light it again you will have to find a place where there is no fire damp Take a long time looking for the place",
"(2) Blacksmiths who make pneumatic picks should not harden them properly so that they will quickly grow dull",
"(3) You can easily put your pneumatic pick out of order Pour a small amount of water through the oil lever and your pick will stop working Coal dust and improper lubrication will also put it out of order",
"(4) Weaken the chain that pulls the bucket conveyers carrying coal A deep dent in the chain made with blows of a pick or shovel will cause it to part under normal strain Once a chain breaks normally or otherwise take your time about reporting the damage; be slow about taking the chain up for repairs and bringing it back down after repairs",
"(5) Derail mine cars by putting obstructions on the rails and in switch points If possible pick a gallery where coal cars have to pass each other so that traffic will be snarled up",
"(6) Send up quantities of rock and other useless material with the coal",
"(5) Production: Agriculture",
"a Machinery",
"(1) See par 5 b (2) c, d, e.",
"b Crops and livestock probably will be destroyed only in areas where there are large food surpluses or where the enemy regime is known to be requisitioning food",
"(1.) Feed crops to livestock Let crops harvest too early or too late Spoil stores of grain fruit and vegetables by soaking them in water so that they will rot Spoil fruit and vegetables by leaving them in the sun",
"(6) Transportation: Railways",
"a Passengers",
"(1.) Make train travel as inconvenient as possible for enemy personnel Make mistakes in issuing train tickets leaving portions of the journey uncovered by the ticket book; issue two tickets for the same seat in the train so that an interesting argument will result; near train time instead of issuing printed tickets write them out slowly by hand prolonging the process until the train is nearly ready to leave or has left the station On station bulletin boards announcing train arrivals and departures see that false and misleading information is given about trains bound for enemy destinations",
"(2) In trains bound for enemy destinations attendants should make life as uncomfortable as possible for passengers See that the food is especially bad take up tickets after midnight call all station stops very loudly during the night handle baggage as noisily as possible during the night and so on",
"(3) See that the luggage of enemy personnel is mislaid or unloaded at the wrong stations",
"Switch address labels on enemy baggage",
"(4) Engineers should see that trains run slow or make unscheduled stops for plausible reasons",
"b Switches Signals and Routing",
"(1) Exchange wires in switchboards containing signals and switches so that they connect to the wrong terminals",
"(2) Loosen push-rods so that signal arms do not work; break signal lights; exchange the colored lenses on red and green lights",
"(3) Spread and spike switch points in the track so that they will not move or place rocks or close-packed dirt between the switch points",
"(4) Sprinkle rock salt or ordinary salt profusely over the electrical connections of switch points and on the ground nearby When it rains the switch will be short-circuited",
"(5) See that cars are put on the wrong trains Remove the labels from cars needing repair and put them on cars in good order Leave couplings between cars as loose as possible",
"c Road-beds and Open Track",
"(1) On a curve take the bolts out of the tie-plates connecting to sections of the outside rail and scoop away the gravel cinders or dirt for a few feet on each side of the connecting joint",
"(2) If by disconnecting the tie-plate at a joint and loosening sleeper nails on each side of the joint it becomes possible to move a sections of rail spread two sections of rail and drive a spike vertically between them",
"d Oil and Lubrication",
"(1) See 5 b (2) b.",
"(2) Squeeze lubricating pipes with pincers or dent them with hammers so that the flow of oil is obstructed",
"e Cooling Systems",
"(1) See 5 b (2) c.",
"f Gasoline and Oil Fuel",
"(1) See 5 b (2) d.",
"g Electric Motors",
"(1) See 5 b (2) e and f.",
"h Boilers",
"(1) See 5 b (2) h.",
"(2) After inspection put heavy oil or tar in the engines' boilers or put half a kilogram of soft soap into the water in the tender",
"i Brakes and Miscellaneous",
"(1) Engines should run at high speeds and use brakes excessively at curves and on downhill grades",
"(2) Punch holes in air-brake valves or water supply pipes",
"(3) In the last car of a passenger train or or a front car of a freight remove the wadding from a journal box and replace it with oily rags",
"(7) Transportation: Automotive",
"a Roads Damage to roads [(3) below] is slow and therefore impractical as a D-day or near D-day activity",
"In areas where traffic is composed primarily of enemy autos trucks and motor convoys of various kinds remove danger signals from curves and intersections",
"(2) When the enemy asks for directions give him wrong information Especially when enemy convoys are in the neighborhood truck drivers can spread rumors and give false information about bridges being out ferries closed and detours lying ahead",
"(3) If you can start damage to a heavily traveled road passing traffic and the elements will do the rest Construction gangs can see that too much sand or water is put in concrete or that the road foundation has soft spots Anyone can scoop ruts in asphalt and macadam roads which turn soft in hot weather; passing trucks will accentuate the ruts to a point where substantial repair will be needed Dirt roads also can be scooped out If you are a road laborer it will be only a few minutes work to divert a small stream from a sluice so that it runs over and eats away the road",
"(4) Distribute broken glass nails and sharp rocks on roads to puncture tires",
"b Passengers",
"c Oil and Lubrication",
"(1) See 5 b (2) b.",
"(2) Disconnect the oil pump; this will burn out the main bearings in less than 50 miles of normal driving",
"d Radiator",
"(1) See 5 b (2) c.",
"e Fuel",
"(1) See 5 b (2) d.",
"f Battery and Ignition",
"(1) Jam bits of wood into the ignition lock; loosen or exchange connections behind the switchboard; put dirt in spark plugs; damage distributor points",
"(2) Turn on the lights in parked cars so that the battery will run down",
"(3) Mechanics can ruin batteries in a number of undetectable ways: Take the valve cap off a cell and drive a screw driver slantwise into the exposed water vent shattering the plates of the cell; no damage will show when you put the cap back on Iron or copper filings put into the cells ie dropped into the acid will greatly shorten its life Copper coins or a few pieces of iron will accomplish the same and more slowly",
"One hundred to 150 cubic centimeters of vinegar in each cell greatly reduces the life of the battery but the odor of the vinegar may reveal what has happened",
"g Gears",
"(1) Remove the lubricant from or put too light a lubricant in the transmission and other gears",
"(2) In trucks tractors and other machines with heavy gears fix the gear case insecurely putting bolts in only half the bolt holes The gears will be badly jolted in use and will soon need repairs",
"h Tires",
"(1) Slash or puncture tires of unguarded vehicles Put a nail inside a match box or other small box and set it vertically in front of the back tire of a stationary car; when the car starts off the nail will go neatly through the tire",
"(2) It is easy to damage a tire in a tire repair shop: In fixing flats spill glass benzine caustic soda or other material inside the casing which will puncture or corrode the tube If you put a gummy substance inside the tube the next flat will stick the tube to the casing and make it unusable Or when you fix a flat tire you can simply leave between the tube and the casing the object which caused the flat in the first place",
"(3) In assembling a tire after repair pump the tube up as fast as you can Instead of filling out smoothly it may crease in which case it will wear out quickly Or as you put a tire together see if you can pinch the tube between the rim of the tire and the rim of the wheel so that a blow-out will result",
"(4) In putting air into tires see that they are kept below normal pressure so that more than an ordinary amount of wear will result In filling tires on double wheels inflate the inner tire to a much higher pressure than the outer one; both will wear out more quickly this way Badly aligned wheels also wear tires out quickly; you can leave wheels out of alignment when they come in for adjustment or you can spring them out of true with a strong kick or by driving the car slowly and diagonally into a curb",
"(5) If you have access to stocks of tires you can rot them by spilling oil gasoline caustic acid or benzine on them Synthetic rubber however is less susceptible to these chemicals",
"(8) Transportation: Water",
"a Navigation",
"(1) Barge and river boat personnel should spread false rumors about the navigability and conditions of the waterways they travel Tell other barge and boat captains to follow channels that will take extra time or cause them to make canal detours",
"(2) Barge and river boat captains should navigate with exceeding caution near locks and bridges to waste their time and to waste the time of other craft which may have to wait on them If you don't pump the bilges of ships and barges often enough they will be slower and harder to navigate Barges accidentally run aground are an efficient time waster too",
"(3) Attendants on swing draw or bascule bridges can delay traffic over the bridge or in the waterway underneath by being slow Boat captains can leave unattended draw bridges open in order to hold up road traffic",
"(4) Add or subtract compensating magnets to the compass on cargo ships Demagnetize the compass or maladjust it by concealing a large bar of steel or iron near to it",
"b Cargo",
"(1) While loading or unloading handle cargo carelessly in order to cause damage Arrange the cargo so that the weakest and lightest crates and boxes will be at the bottom of the hold while the heaviest ones are on top of them",
"Put hatch covers and tarpaulins on sloppily so that rain and deck wash will injure the cargo",
"Tie float valves open so that storage tanks will overflow on perishable goods",
"(9) Communications",
"a Telephone",
"(1) At office hotel and exchange switch boards delay putting enemy calls through give them wrong numbers cut them off accidentally or forget to disconnect them so that the line cannot be used again",
"(2) Hamper official and especially military business by making at least one telephone call a day to an enemy headquarters; when you get them tell them you have the wrong number",
"Call military or police offices and make anonymous false reports of fires air raids bombs",
"(3) In offices and buildings used by the enemy unscrew the earphone of telephone receivers and remove the diaphragm Electricians and telephone repair men can make poor connections and damage insulation so that cross talk and other kinds of electrical interference will make conversations hard or impossible to understand",
"(4) Put the batteries under automatic switchboards out of commission by dropping nails metal filings or coins into the cells If you can treat half the batteries in this way the switchboard will stop working A whole telephone system can be disrupted if you can put 10 percent of the cells in half the batteries of the central battery room out of order",
"b Telegraph",
"(1) Delay the transmission and delivery of telegrams to enemy destinations",
"(2) Garble telegrams to enemy destinations so that another telegram will have to be sent or a long distance call will have to be made Sometimes it will be possible to do this by changing a single letter in a word — for example changing minimum to maximum so that the person receiving the telegram will not know whether minimum or maximum is meant",
"c Transportation Lines",
"(1) Cut telephone and telegraph transmission lines Damage insulation on power lines to cause interference",
"d Mail",
"(1) Post office employees can see to it that enemy mail is always delayed by one day or more that it is put in wrong sacks and so on",
"e Motion Pictures",
"(1) Projector operators can ruin newsreels and other enemy propaganda films by bad focusing speeding up or slowing down the film and by causing frequent breakage in the film",
"(2) Audiences can ruin enemy propaganda films by applauding to drown the words of the speaker by coughing loudly and by talking",
"(3) Anyone can break up a showing of an enemy propaganda film by putting two or three dozen large moths in a paper bag Take the bag to the movies with you put it on the floor in an empty section of the theater as you go in and leave it open The moths will fly out and climb into the projector beam so that the film will be obscured by fluttering shadows",
"f Radio",
"(1) Station engineers will find it quite easy to overmodulate transmissions of talks by persons giving enemy propaganda or instructions so that they will sound as if they were talking through a heavy cotton blanket with a mouth full of marbles",
"(2) In your own apartment building you can interfere with radio reception at times when the enemy wants everybody to listen Take an electric light plug off the end of an electric light cord; take some wire out of the cord and tie it across two terminals of a two-prong plug or three terminals of a four-prong plug Then take it around and put it into as many wall and floor outlets as you can find Each time you insert the plug into a new circuit you will blow out a fuse and silence all radios running on power from that circuit until a new fuse is put in",

"CONTENTS 1. INTRODUCTION 2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS 3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR 4. TOOLS TARGETS AND TIMING 5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE",
"1. INTRODUCTION",
"The purpose of this paper is to characterize simple sabotage to outline its possible effects and to present suggestions for inciting and executing it",
"Sabotage varies from highly technical coup de main acts that require detailed planning and the use of specially-trained operatives to innumerable simple acts which the ordinary individual citizen-saboteur can perform This paper is primarily concerned with the latter type Simple sabotage does not require specially prepared tools or equipment; it is executed by an ordinary citizen who may or may not act individually and without the necessity for active connection with an organized group; and it is carried out in such a way as to involve a minimum danger of injury detection and reprisal",
"A second type of simple sabotage requires no destructive tools whatsoever and produces physical damage if any by highly indirect means It is based on universal opportunities to make faulty decisions to adopt a noncooperative attitude and to induce others to follow suit Making a faulty decision may be simply a matter of placing tools in one spot instead of another A non-cooperative attitude may involve nothing more than creating an unpleasant situation among one's fellow workers engaging in bickerings or displaying surliness and stupidity",
"2. POSSIBLE EFFECTS",
"Acts of simple sabotage are occurring throughout Europe An effort should be made to add to their efficiency lessen their detectability and increase their number Acts of simple sabotage multiplied by thousands of citizen-saboteurs can be an effective weapon against the enemy Slashing tires draining fuel tanks starting fires starting arguments acting stupidly short-circuiting electric systems abrading machine parts will waste materials manpower and time Occurring on a wide scale simple sabotage will be a constant and tangible drag on the war effort of the enemy",
"Simple sabotage may also have secondary results of more or less value Widespread practice of simple sabotage will harass and demoralize enemy administrators and police Further success may embolden the citizen-saboteur eventually to find colleagues who can assist him in sabotage of greater dimensions Finally the very practice of simple sabotage by natives in enemy or occupied territory may make these individuals identify themselves actively with the United Nations war effort and encourage them to assist openly in periods of Allied invasion and occupation",
"3. MOTIVATING THE SABOTEUR",
"To incite the citizen to the active practice of simple sabotage and to keep him practicing that sabotage over sustained periods is a special problem",
"(1) Personal Motives",
"c More important than a or b would be to create a situation in which the citizen-saboteur acquires a sense of responsibility and begins to educate others in simple sabotage",
"(2) Encouraging Destructiveness",
"d Various media may be used to disseminate suggestions and information regarding simple sabotage Among the media which may be used as the immediate situation dictates are: freedom stations or radio false unreadable broadcasts or leaflets may be directed toward specific geographic or occupational areas or they may be general in scope Finally agents may be trained in the art of simple sabotage in anticipation of a time when they may be able to communicate this information directly",
"(3) Safety Measures",
"b It should not be difficult to prepare leaflets and other media for the saboteur about the choice of weapons time and targets which will insure the saboteur against detection and retaliation Among such suggestions might be the following:",
"(1) Use materials which appear to be innocent A knife or a nail file can be carried normally on your person; either is a multi-purpose instrument for creating damage Matches pebbles hair salt nails and dozens of other destructive agents can be carried or kept in your living quarters without exciting any suspicion whatever If you are a worker in a particular trade or industry you can easily carry and keep such things as wrenches hammers emery paper and the like",
"(2) Try to commit acts for which large numbers of people could be responsible For instance if you blow out the wiring in a factory at a central fire box almost anyone could have done it On-the-street sabotage after dark such as you might be able to carry out against a military car or truck is another example of an act for which it would be impossible to blame you",
"(3) Do not be afraid to commit acts for which you might be blamed directly so long as you do so rarely and as long as you have a plausible excuse: you dropped your wrench across an electric circuit because an air raid had kept you up the night before and you were half-dozing at work Always be profuse in your apologies Frequently you can get away with such acts under the cover of pretending stupidity ignorance over-caution fear of being suspected of sabotage or weakness and dullness due to undernourishment",
"(4) After you have committed an act of easy sabotage resist any temptation to wait around and see what happens Loiterers arouse suspicion Of course there are circumstances when it would be suspicious for you to leave If you commit sabotage on your job you should naturally stay at your work",
"4. TOOLS TARGETS AND TIMING",
"The citizen-saboteur cannot be closely controlled Nor is it reasonable to expect that simple sabotage can be precisely concentrated on specific types of target according to the requirements of a concrete military situation Attempts to control simple sabotage according to developing military factors moreover might provide the enemy with intelligence of more or less value in anticipating the date and area of notably intensified or notably slackened military activity",
"Sabotage suggestions of course should be adapted to fit the area where they are to be practiced Target priorities for general types of situations likewise can be specified for emphasis at the proper time by the underground press freedom stations and cooperating propaganda",
"(1) Under General Conditions",
"a Simple sabotage is more than malicious mischief and it should always consist of acts whose results will be detrimental to the materials and manpower of the enemy",
"d The saboteur should try to damage only objects and materials known to be in use by the enemy or to be destined for early use by the enemy It will be safe for him to assume that almost any product of heavy industry is destined for enemy use and that the most efficient fuels and lubricants also are destined for enemy use Without special knowledge however it would be undesirable for him to attempt destruction of food crops or food products",
"(2) Prior to a Military Offensive During periods which are quiescent in a military sense such emphasis as can be given to simple sabotage might well center on industrial production to lessen the flow of materials and equipment to the enemy Slashing a rubber tire on an Army truck may be an act of value; spoiling a batch of rubber in the production plant is an act of still more value",
"(3) During a Military Offensive",
"a Most significant sabotage for an area which is or is soon destined to be a theater of combat operations is that whose effects will be direct and immediate Even if the effects are relatively minor and localized this type of sabotage is to be preferred to activities whose effects while widespread are indirect and delayed",
"(1) The saboteur should be encouraged to attack transportation facilities of all kinds",
"Among such facilities are roads railroads auto mobiles trucks motor-cycles bicycles trains and trams",
"(2) Any communications facilities which can be used by the authorities to transmit instructions or morale material should be the objects of simple sabotage These include telephone telegraph and power systems radio newspapers placards and public notices",
"(3) Critical materials valuable in themselves or necessary to the efficient functioning of transportation and communication also should become targets for the citizen-saboteur These may include oil gasoline tires food and water",
"5. SPECIFIC SUGGESTIONS FOR SIMPLE SABOTAGE",
"It will not be possible to evaluate the desirability of simple sabotage in an area without having in mind rather specifically what individual acts and results are embraced by the definition of simple sabotage",
"A listing of specific acts follows classified according to types of target This list is presented as a growing rather than a complete outline of the methods of simple sabotage As new techniques are developed or new fields explored it will be elaborated and expanded",
"(1) Buildings",
"Warehouses barracks offices hotels and factory buildings are outstanding targets for simple sabotage They are extremely susceptible to damage especially by fire; they offer opportunities to such untrained people as janitors charwomen and casual visitors; and when damaged they present a relatively large handicap to the enemy",
"a Fires can be started wherever there is an accumulation of inflammable material Warehouses are obviously the most promising targets but incendiary sabotage need not be confined to them alone",
"(1) Whenever possible arrange to have the fire start after you have gone away Use a candle and paper combination setting it as close as possible to the inflammable material you want to burn: From a sheet of paper tear a strip three or four centimeters wide and wrap it around the base of the candle two or three times Twist more sheets of paper into loose ropes and place them around the base of the candle When the candle flame reaches the encircling strip it will be ignited and in turn will ignite the surrounding paper The size heat and duration of the resulting flame will depend on how much paper you use and how much of it you can cramp in a small space",
"(2) With a flame of this kind do not attempt to ignite any but rather inflammable materials such as cotton sacking To light more resistant materials use a candle plus tightly rolled or twisted paper which has been soaked in gasoline To create a briefer but even hotter flame put celluloid such as you might find in an old comb into a nest of plain or saturated paper which is to be fired by a candle",
"(3) To make another type of simple fuse soak one end of a piece of string in grease Rub a generous pinch of gunpowder over the inch of string where greasy string meets clean string Then ignite the clean end of the string It will burn slowly without a flame in much the same way that a cigarette burns until it reaches the grease and gunpowder; it will then flare up suddenly The grease-treated string will then burn with a flame The same effect may be achieved by using matches instead of the grease and gunpowder Run the string over the match heads taking care that the string is not pressed or knotted They too will produce a sudden flame The advantage of this type of fuse is that string burns at a set speed You can time your fire by the length and thickness of the string you chose",
"(4) Use a fuse such as; the ones suggested above to start a fire in an office after hours The destruction of records and other types of documents would be a serious handicap to the enemy",
"(5) In basements where waste is kept janitors should accumulate oily and greasy waste Such waste sometimes ignites spontaneously but it can easily be lit with a cigarette or match If you are a janitor on night duty you can be the first to report the fire but don't report it too soon",
"(6) A clean factory is not susceptible to fire but a dirty one is Workers should be careless with refuse and janitors should be inefficient in cleaning If enough dirt and trash can be accumulated an otherwise fireproof building will become inflammable",
"(7) Where illuminating gas is used in a room which is vacant at night shut the windows tightly turn on the gas and leave a candle burning in the room closing the door tightly behind you After a time the gas will explode and a fire may or may not follow",
"b Water and miscellaneous",
"(1) Ruin warehouse stock by setting the automatic sprinkler system to work You can do this by tapping the sprinkler heads sharply with a hammer or by holding a match under them",
"(2) Forget to provide paper in toilets; put tightly rolled paper hair and other obstructions in the W C Saturate a sponge with a thick starch or sugar solution Squeeze it tightly into a ball wrap it with string and dry Remove the string when fully dried The sponge will be in the form of a tight hard ball Flush down a",
"W C or otherwise introduce into a sewer line The sponge will gradually expand to its normal size and plug the sewage system",
"(3) Put a coin beneath a bulb in a public building during the daytime so that fuses will blow out when lights are turned on at night The fuses themselves may be rendered ineffective by putting a coin behind them or loading them with heavy wire Then a short-circuit may either start a fire damage transformers or blow out a central fuse which will interrupt distribution of electricity to a large area",
"(4) Jam paper bits of wood hairpins and anything else that will fit into the locks of all unguarded entrances to public buildings",
"(2) Industrial Production: Manufacturing",

"(3) Using a very rapid stroke will wear out a file before its time So will dragging a file in slow strokes under heavy pressure Exert pressure on the backward stroke as well as the forward stroke",
"(4) Clean files by knocking them against the vise or the workpiece; they are easily broken this way",
"(5) Bits and drills will snap under heavy pressure",
"(6) You can put a press punch out of order by putting in it more material than it is adjusted for—two blanks instead of one for example",
"(7) Power-driven tools like pneumatic drills riveters and so on are never efficient when dirty Lubrication points and electric contacts can easily be fouled by normal accumulations of dirt or the insertion of foreign matter",
"b Oil and lubrication systems are not only vulnerable to easy sabotage but are critical in every machine with moving parts Sabotage of oil and lubrication will slow production or stop work entirely at strategic points in industrial processes",
"(1) Put metal dust or filings fine sand ground glass emery dust get it by pounding up an emery knife sharpener and similar hard gritty substances directly into lubrication systems They will scour smooth surfaces ruining pistons cylinder walls shafts and bearings They will overheat and stop motors which will need overhauling new parts and extensive repairs Such materials if they are used should be introduced into lubrication systems past any filters which otherwise would strain them out",
"(2) You can cause wear on any machine by uncovering a filter system poking a pencil or any other sharp object through the filter mesh then covering it up again Or if you can dispose of it quickly simply remove the filter",
"(3) If you cannot get at the lubrication system or filter directly you may be able to lessen the effectiveness of oil by diluting it in storage In this case almost any liquid will do which will thin the oil A small amount of sulphuric acid varnish water-glass or linseed oil will be especially effective",
"(4) Using a thin oil where a heavy oil is prescribed will break down a machine or heat up a moving shaft so that it will freeze and stop",
"(5) Put any clogging substance into lubrication systems or if it will float into stored oil Twisted combings of human hair pieces of string dead insects and many other common objects will be effective in stopping or hindering the flow of oil through feed lines and filters",
"(6) Under some circumstances you may be able to destroy oil outright rather than interfere with its effectiveness by removing stop-plugs from lubricating systems or by puncturing the drums and cans in which it is stored",
"c Cooling Systems (1.) A water cooling system can be put out of commission in a fairly short time with considerable damage to an engine or motor if you put into it several pinches of hard grain such as rice or wheat They will swell up and choke the circulation of water and the cooling system will have to be torn down to remove the obstruction Sawdust or hair may also be used to clog a water cooling system",
"(2) If very cold water is quickly introduced into the cooling system of an overheated motor contraction and considerable strain on the engine housing will result If you can repeat the treatment a few times cracking and serious damage will result",
"(3) You can ruin the effectiveness of an air cooling system by plugging dirt and waste into intake or exhaust valves If a belt-run fan is used in the system make a jagged cut at least half way through the belt; it will slip and finally part under strain and the motor will overheat",
"d Gasoline and Oil Fuel Tanks and fueling engines usually are accessible and easy to open They afford a very vulnerable target for simple sabotage activities (1.) Put several pinches of sawdust or hard grain such as rice or wheat into the fuel tank of a gasoline engine The particles will choke a feed line so that the engine will stop Some time will be required to discover the source of the trouble Although they will be hard to get crumbs of natural rubber such as you might find in old rubber bands and pencil erasers are also effective",
"(2) If you can accumulate sugar put it in the fuel tank of a gasoline engine As it burns together with the gasoline it will turn into a sticky mess which will completely mire the engine and necessitate extensive cleaning and repair Honey and molasses are as good as sugar Try to use about 75-100 grams for each 10 gallons of gasoline",
"(3) Other impurities which you can introduce into gasoline will cause rapid engine wear and eventual breakdown Fine particles of pumice sand ground glass and metal dust can easily be introduced into a gasoline tank Be sure that the particles are very fine so that they will be able to pass through the carburetor jet",
"(4) Water urine wine or any other simple liquid you can get in reasonably large quantities will dilute gasoline fuel to a point where no combustion will occur in the cylinder and the engine will not move One pint to 20 gallons of gasoline is sufficient If salt water is used it will cause corrosion and permanent motor damage",
"(5) In the case of Diesel engines put low flashpoint oil into the fuel tank; the engine will not move If there already is proper oil in the tank when the wrong kind is added the engine will only limp and sputter along",
"(6) Fuel lines to gasoline and oil engines frequently pass over the exhaust pipe When the machine is at rest you can stab a small hole in the fuel line and plug the hole with wax As the engine runs and the exhaust tube becomes hot the wax will be melted; fuel will drip onto the exhaust and a blaze will start",
"(7) If you have access to a room where gasoline is stored remember that gas vapor accumulating in a closed room will explode after a time if you leave a candle burning in the room A good deal of evaporation however must occur from the gasoline tins into the air of the room If removal of the tops of the tins does not expose enough gasoline to the air to ensure copious evaporation you can open lightly constructed tins further with a knife ice pick or sharpened nail file Or puncture a tiny hole in the tank which will permit gasoline to leak out on the floor This will greatly increase the rate of evaporation Before you light your candle be sure that windows are closed and the room is as air-tight as you can make it If you can see that windows in a neighboring room are opened wide you have a chance of setting a large fire which will not only destroy the gasoline but anything else nearby; when the gasoline explodes the doors of the storage room will be blown open a draft to the neighboring windows will be created which will whip up a fine conflagration",
"e Electric Motors Electric motors including dynamos are more restricted than the targets so far discussed They cannot be sabotaged easily or without risk of injury by unskilled persons who may otherwise have good opportunities for destruction",
"(1) Set the rheostat to a high point of resistance in all types of electric motors They will overheat and catch fire",
"(2) Adjust the overload relay to a very high value beyond the capacity of the motor Then overload the motor to a point where it will overheat and break down",
"(3) Remember that dust dirt and moisture are enemies of electrical equipment Spill dust and dirt onto the points where the wires in electric motors connect with terminals and onto insulating parts Inefficient transmission of current and in some cases short circuits will result Wet generator motors to produce short circuits",
"(4) Accidentally bruise the insulation on wire loosen nuts on connections make faulty splices and faulty connections in wiring to waste electric current and reduce the power of electric motors the power output or cause short circuiting in direct-current motors: Loosen or remove commutator holding rings Sprinkle carbon graphite or metal dust on commutators Put a little grease or oil at the contact points of commutators Where commutator bars are close together bridge the gaps between them with metal dust or sawtooth their edges with a chisel so that the teeth on adjoining bars meet or nearly meet and current can pass from one to the other",
"(6) Put a piece of finely grained emery paper half the size of a postage stamp in a place where it will wear away rotating brushes The emery paper and the motor will be destroyed in the resulting fire",
"(7) Sprinkle carbon graphite or metal dust on slip-rings so that the current will leak or short circuits will occur When a motor is idle nick the slip-rings with a chisel",

"g Turbines for the most part are heavily built stoutly housed and difficult of access Their vulnerability to simple sabotage is very low",
"(1) After inspecting or repairing a hydro turbine fasten the cover insecurely so that it will blow off and flood the plant with water A loose cover on a steam turbine will cause it to leak and slow down",
"(2) In water turbines insert a large piece of scrap iron in the head of the penstock just beyond the screening so that water will carry the damaging material down to the plant equipment",
"(3) When the steam line to a turbine is opened for repair put pieces of scrap iron into it to be blasted into the turbine machinery when steam is up again",
"(4) Create a leak in the line feeding oil to the turbine so that oil will fall on the hot steam pipe and cause a fire",
"h Boilers",
"(1) Reduce the efficiency of steam boilers any way you can Put too much water in them to make them slow-starting or keep the fire under them low to keep them inefficient Let them dry and turn the fire up; they will crack and be ruined An especially good trick is to keep putting limestone or water containing lime in the boiler; it will deposit lime on the bottom and sides This deposit will provide very good insulation against heat; after enough of it has collected the boiler will be completely worthless",
"(3) Production Metals",
"a Iron and Steel",
"(1) Keep blast furnaces in a condition where they must be frequently shut down for repair In making fire-proof bricks for the inner lining of blast furnaces put in an extra proportion of tar so that they will wear out quickly and necessitate constant re-lining",

"(2) Blacksmiths who make pneumatic picks should not harden them properly so that they will quickly grow dull",
"(3) You can easily put your pneumatic pick out of order Pour a small amount of water through the oil lever and your pick will stop working Coal dust and improper lubrication will also put it out of order",
"(4) Weaken the chain that pulls the bucket conveyers carrying coal A deep dent in the chain made with blows of a pick or shovel will cause it to part under normal strain Once a chain breaks normally or otherwise take your time about reporting the damage; be slow about taking the chain up for repairs and bringing it back down after repairs",

"(6) Transportation: Railways",
"a Passengers",
"(1.) Make train travel as inconvenient as possible for enemy personnel Make mistakes in issuing train tickets leaving portions of the journey uncovered by the ticket book; issue two tickets for the same seat in the train so that an interesting argument will result; near train time instead of issuing printed tickets write them out slowly by hand prolonging the process until the train is nearly ready to leave or has left the station On station bulletin boards announcing train arrivals and departures see that false and misleading information is given about trains bound for enemy destinations",
"(2) In trains bound for enemy destinations attendants should make life as uncomfortable as possible for passengers See that the food is especially bad take up tickets after midnight call all station stops very loudly during the night handle baggage as noisily as possible during the night and so on",
"(3) See that the luggage of enemy personnel is mislaid or unloaded at the wrong stations",

"(3) In the last car of a passenger train or or a front car of a freight remove the wadding from a journal box and replace it with oily rags",
"(7) Transportation: Automotive",
"a Roads Damage to roads [(3) below] is slow and therefore impractical as a D-day or near D-day activity",
"In areas where traffic is composed primarily of enemy autos trucks and motor convoys of various kinds remove danger signals from curves and intersections",
"(2) When the enemy asks for directions give him wrong information Especially when enemy convoys are in the neighborhood truck drivers can spread rumors and give false information about bridges being out ferries closed and detours lying ahead",
"(3) If you can start damage to a heavily traveled road passing traffic and the elements will do the rest Construction gangs can see that too much sand or water is put in concrete or that the road foundation has soft spots Anyone can scoop ruts in asphalt and macadam roads which turn soft in hot weather; passing trucks will accentuate the ruts to a point where substantial repair will be needed Dirt roads also can be scooped out If you are a road laborer it will be only a few minutes work to divert a small stream from a sluice so that it runs over and eats away the road",
"(4) Distribute broken glass nails and sharp rocks on roads to puncture tires",

"f Battery and Ignition",
"(1) Jam bits of wood into the ignition lock; loosen or exchange connections behind the switchboard; put dirt in spark plugs; damage distributor points",
"(2) Turn on the lights in parked cars so that the battery will run down",
"(3) Mechanics can ruin batteries in a number of undetectable ways: Take the valve cap off a cell and drive a screw driver slantwise into the exposed water vent shattering the plates of the cell; no damage will show when you put the cap back on Iron or copper filings put into the cells ie dropped into the acid will greatly shorten its life Copper coins or a few pieces of iron will accomplish the same and more slowly",
"One hundred to 150 cubic centimeters of vinegar in each cell greatly reduces the life of the battery but the odor of the vinegar may reveal what has happened",
"g Gears",
"(1) Remove the lubricant from or put too light a lubricant in the transmission and other gears",
"(2) In trucks tractors and other machines with heavy gears fix the gear case insecurely putting bolts in only half the bolt holes The gears will be badly jolted in use and will soon need repairs",
"h Tires",
"(1) Slash or puncture tires of unguarded vehicles Put a nail inside a match box or other small box and set it vertically in front of the back tire of a stationary car; when the car starts off the nail will go neatly through the tire",
"(2) It is easy to damage a tire in a tire repair shop: In fixing flats spill glass benzine caustic soda or other material inside the casing which will puncture or corrode the tube If you put a gummy substance inside the tube the next flat will stick the tube to the casing and make it unusable Or when you fix a flat tire you can simply leave between the tube and the casing the object which caused the flat in the first place",
"(3) In assembling a tire after repair pump the tube up as fast as you can Instead of filling out smoothly it may crease in which case it will wear out quickly Or as you put a tire together see if you can pinch the tube between the rim of the tire and the rim of the wheel so that a blow-out will result",
"(4) In putting air into tires see that they are kept below normal pressure so that more than an ordinary amount of wear will result In filling tires on double wheels inflate the inner tire to a much higher pressure than the outer one; both will wear out more quickly this way Badly aligned wheels also wear tires out quickly; you can leave wheels out of alignment when they come in for adjustment or you can spring them out of true with a strong kick or by driving the car slowly and diagonally into a curb",
"(5) If you have access to stocks of tires you can rot them by spilling oil gasoline caustic acid or benzine on them Synthetic rubber however is less susceptible to these chemicals",

"a Navigation",
"(1) Barge and river boat personnel should spread false rumors about the navigability and conditions of the waterways they travel Tell other barge and boat captains to follow channels that will take extra time or cause them to make canal detours",
"(2) Barge and river boat captains should navigate with exceeding caution near locks and bridges to waste their time and to waste the time of other craft which may have to wait on them If you don't pump the bilges of ships and barges often enough they will be slower and harder to navigate Barges accidentally run aground are an efficient time waster too",
"(3) Attendants on swing draw or bascule bridges can delay traffic over the bridge or in the waterway underneath by being slow Boat captains can leave unattended draw bridges open in order to hold up road traffic",
"(4) Add or subtract compensating magnets to the compass on cargo ships Demagnetize the compass or maladjust it by concealing a large bar of steel or iron near to it",

"(2) Hamper official and especially military business by making at least one telephone call a day to an enemy headquarters; when you get them tell them you have the wrong number",
"Call military or police offices and make anonymous false reports of fires air raids bombs",
"(3) In offices and buildings used by the enemy unscrew the earphone of telephone receivers and remove the diaphragm Electricians and telephone repair men can make poor connections and damage insulation so that cross talk and other kinds of electrical interference will make conversations hard or impossible to understand",
"(4) Put the batteries under automatic switchboards out of commission by dropping nails metal filings or coins into the cells If you can treat half the batteries in this way the switchboard will stop working A whole telephone system can be disrupted if you can put 10 percent of the cells in half the batteries of the central battery room out of order",
"b Telegraph",
"(1) Delay the transmission and delivery of telegrams to enemy destinations",
"(2) Garble telegrams to enemy destinations so that another telegram will have to be sent or a long distance call will have to be made Sometimes it will be possible to do this by changing a single letter in a word — for example changing minimum to maximum so that the person receiving the telegram will not know whether minimum or maximum is meant",
"c Transportation Lines",
"(1) Cut telephone and telegraph transmission lines Damage insulation on power lines to cause interference",
"d Mail",
"(1) Post office employees can see to it that enemy mail is always delayed by one day or more that it is put in wrong sacks and so on",

"(1) Projector operators can ruin newsreels and other enemy propaganda films by bad focusing speeding up or slowing down the film and by causing frequent breakage in the film 23",
"RULES FOR ROASTING",
"To roast successfully make up a nice clear fire When once made up it should be replenished if necessary by putting on coal or coke at the back The live coals should be drawn to the front to prevent smoke Fasten the joint to the jack Place the roaster close to the fire for the first ten minutes so that the heat of the fire may at once harden the albumen and form a case to keep in the flavour and juices Afterwards draw the roaster farther back and cook gradually basting every ten minutes The basting keeps the meat from drying up and gives it a better flavour The length of time allowed for roasting is the same as for boiling the rule being a quarter of an hour for each pound and a quarter of an hour over For white meat veal and pork or solid joints without bone allow twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes over These rules however cannot always be strictly adhered to as the size and shape of the joint must be taken into consideration as well as the weight Meat that has been frozen will take longer to cook than fresh meat Meat which has been well hung will take a shorter time than fresh meat If a jack is not used the joint should be fastened to a rope of worsted which should be kept constantly turning",
"Gravy for a joint may be made according to two methods The first method is to take the dripping-pan away half an hour before the joint is cooked then to put a hot dish in its place and to pour the contents of the pan into a basin Put the basin into a refrigerator; or place it on ice As soon as it is cold the fat will cake on the top of the gravy and should be removed very carefully Make 24the gravy hot diluting it with warm water if necessary and pour it round the joint",
"The other and more usual method of making gravy is to pour away all the fat from the pan as soon as the joint is cooked; and then pour into the pan a sufficient quantity of hot water scraping well the brown glaze from the bottom; colour carefully with caramel or burnt sugar and pour it round the joint not over it Pouring the gravy over the meat destroys its crispness",
"On no account make gravy from stock; stock is quite unsuitable as the vegetable flavour is to many persons disagreeable",
"RULES FOR FRYING",
"French or Wet Frying",
"This is cooking in a large quantity of fat sufficient to cover the articles fried in it Oil lard dripping or fat rendered down may be used for this purpose Oil is considered the best as it will rise to 600° without burning; other fats get over-heated after 400°, and therefore require greater care in using Success depends almost entirely on getting the fat to the right degree of heat For ordinary frying the heat required is 345°. Unless this point is carefully attended to total failure will be the result There are signs however by which anyone may easily tell when the fat is ready for use It must be quite still making no noise; noise or bubbling will be caused by the evaporation of moisture or water in it The expression ‘boiling lard’ or ‘boiling fat’ has been misleading to many inexperienced cooks who not unnaturally imagine that when the fat is bubbling like boiling water it is boiling and therefore at the right heat 25But boiling fat does not bubble When it has the appearance of boiling water it is simply due as already explained to the presence of water in it which must pass away by evaporation before the fat can reach the required heat When it ceases to make any noise and is quite still it should be carefully watched; for very soon a pale blue vapour is seen rising and then the fat is sufficiently hot If from the position of the stove it is not easy to see this vapour a piece of bread may be held in the fat as a test; if it begins to turn brown in about a minute the fat is ready It should then be used without delay; since when once hot enough it rapidly gets overheated or burnt Fat is burning when the blue vapour becomes like smoke Burnt fat has an unpleasant smell and is apt to give a disagreeable taste to the articles fried in it With ordinary care fat need not get overheated Next to oil fat rendered down see Rendering down Fat, is best for the purpose If strained after each time of using and not allowed to burn it will keep good for months and may be used for fish sweets or savouries and no taste of anything previously fried in it will be given to the articles cooked For this kind of frying a kitchener or gas stove is preferable to an open range",
"All kinds of rissoles croquettes fillets and cutlets of fish fritters &c should be fried in this manner and should not be darker than a golden brown It is an advantage to use a frying-basket for all such things as are covered with egg and bread-crumbs; but fritters or whatever is dipped in batter should be dropped into the fat as they become so light that they rise to the top of it When they are a pale fawn colour on the one side they should be turned over to the other Care must be taken to drain everything after frying on kitchen paper in order to remove any grease 26",
"Dry Frying",
"This is frying in a cutlet or frying pan with a small quantity of fat and is only suitable for such things as require slow cooking such as steaks mutton or veal cutlets fillets of beef liver and bacon Pancakes also are fried in this manner Success depends as in French frying in having the fat rightly heated taking care that the outside of the meat cooked be sealed up In this way the juices and flavour will be retained in it Make therefore the frying-pan hot then put in the fat; and when that is also perfectly hot put in the meat to be cooked When each side has been well sealed up the heat applied must be moderated so that the cooking may be gradual The common mistake in this kind of frying is to put the meat into the fat when it is but barely melted; the juices of the meat are thus allowed to escape and the meat is toughened",
"RULES FOR BAKING",
"To bake meat successfully the oven must be well ventilated otherwise the joint cooked in this manner will have an unpleasant flavour The meat should be put on a trivet which should be placed on a baking-tin The oven must be very hot when the meat is put into it and the heat should be kept up for the first quarter of an hour This is to form the casing already alluded to in the directions for roasting and boiling; the heat of the oven must then be very much moderated and the joint cooked very gradually allowing twenty minutes for every pound and twenty minutes over The meat should be basted; and the gravy may be made in the same manner as in roasting 27",
"RULES FOR GRILLING",
"For this method of cookery a clear fire is essential The griller is warmed and the meat fastened in it It is then hung on the bars of the fireplace and a dish passed underneath to catch any gravy An ordinary sized chop cooked in this way will take about five minutes on the one side and three on the other",
"RULES FOR BROILING",
"This is cooking over the fire on a gridiron The flavour of broiled meat is usually preferred to that of grilled Put the gridiron over the fire to heat and then put the chop or steak on it; place the gridiron close to the fire at first that the heat may rapidly seal up the outside of the meat When this has been accomplished lift the gridiron further from the fire and cook gradually turning occasionally A clear fire is essential Coke is better than coal for broiling because there is less smoke from it 28",
"JOINTS",
"Sirloin of Beef",
"This is the primest joint and must be either roasted or baked see directions. Horse-radish should be served with it Yorkshire pudding is also liked with roast beef",

"All these are either roasted or boiled and served with mint sauce",
"Fillet of Veal",
"But in spite of the fact that the Ancient Egyptians enjoy rather more popularity than their contemporaries it is evident that the books which they wrote are closed books to those who have not the glamour of vanished peoples and the fascination of mighty cities now made desolate strong upon them",
"Yet in the heterogeneous and pitiful flotsam that reluctant seas have washed to us piecemeal from a remote past there are as will be shown later many things which although proceeding from a culture and modes of thought as far removed from our own as they may well be[1] are worth the reading which do not require any special knowledge for their understanding; and of these are the translations in this book",
"The following pages which although addressed to the 'general reader' may yet be of some assistance to those especially interested in Egypt give among other matters the place of the Instructions of Ptah-hotep and Ke'gemni in the 'literature' of Egypt; their place—their {17} unique place—in the literature of the world; their value historically; a description of the document in which they were found; what is known of their authors; a discussion of their contents",
"But apart from the mazes of mythology the broken ways of history and the empty letter of a dead faith there are as is known to some and as this little book professes to show many documents which are antique but not antiquated possessing interest above the purely archaeological—the interest called human Of these are the tales which recall in incident as in style those of the immortal collection full of the whole glamour of the East the Thousand Nights and a Night {18} Such are the love-songs full of the burning utterance of desire; the pathetic and even bitter dirges whose singers have seen all the works that are done under the sun and found all to be vanity and vexation of spirit And such also are the didactic poems for the instruction of youth which—in poetic phrase and in great detail—inculcate among other things the practice of right conduct as the price of happiness; a courtesy hardly less considerate than our own; and a charity which when certain inevitable shortcomings are allowed for bears comparison with almost any later system Out of these there are many that may properly claim a place in a series bearing the seal of the Wisdom of the East though they belong only to the more objective and 'practical' side of that Wisdom",
"But as touching the books here translated—the Instructions of Ptah-hotep and of Ke'gemni—they possess apart from the curious nature of their contents a feature of the greatest interest and an adequate claim on the notice of all persons interested in literature and its history For if the datings and ascriptions in them be accepted as trustworthy there is no reason why they should not be so accepted, they were composed about four thousand years before Christ and three thousand five hundred and fifty years before Christ respectively And the significance of those remote dates is that they are the oldest {19} books in the world the earliest extant specimens of the literary art They stand on the extreme horizon of all that ocean of paper and ink that has become to us as an atmosphere a fifth element an essential of life",
"Nor do the oldest books of any other country approach these two in antiquity To draw {20} comparisons between them let us in imagination place ourselves at the period at which Ptah-hotep lived that is about BC 3550, 'under King Isôsi living for ever' and take a glance at futurity",

"CHAPTER III  INFLAMMATION",
"Definition —Nature of inflammation from surgical point of view —Sequence of changes in bacterial inflammation —Clinical aspects of inflammation —General principles of treatment —Chronic inflammation",
"Inflammation may be defined as the series of vital changes that occurs in the tissues in response to irritation These changes represent the reaction of the tissue elements to the irritant and constitute the attempt made by nature to arrest or to limit its injurious effects and to repair the damage done by it",
"The phenomena which characterise the inflammatory reaction can be induced by any form of irritation—such for example as mechanical injury the application of heat or of chemical substances or the action of pathogenic bacteria and their toxins—and they are essentially similar in kind whatever the irritant may be The extent to which the process may go however and its effects on the part implicated and on the system as a whole vary with different irritants and with the intensity and duration of their action A mechanical a thermal or a chemical irritant acting alone induces a degree of reaction directly proportionate to its physical properties and so long as it does not completely destroy the vitality of the part involved the changes in the tissues are chiefly directed towards repairing the damage done to the part and the inflammatory reaction is not only compatible with the occurrence of ideal repair but may be looked upon as an integral step in the reparative process",
"The irritation caused by infection with bacteria on the other hand is cumulative as the organisms not only multiply in the tissues but in addition produce chemical poisons toxins which aggravate the irritative effects The resulting reaction is correspondingly progressive and has as its primary object the expulsion of the irritant and the limitation of its action If the natural protective effort is successful the resulting tissue changes subserve the process of repair but if the bacteria gain the upper hand in the struggle the inflammatory reaction becomes more intense certain of the tissue elements succumb and the process for the time being is a destructive one During the stage of bacterial inflammation reparative processes are in abeyance and it is only after the inflammation has been allayed either by natural means or by the aid of the surgeon that repair takes place",
"In applying the antiseptic principle to the treatment of wounds our main object is to exclude or to eliminate the bacterial factor and so to prevent the inflammatory reaction going beyond the stage in which it is protective and just in proportion as we succeed in attaining this object do we favour the occurrence of ideal repair",
"Sequence of Changes in Bacterial Inflammation—As the form of inflammation with which we are most concerned is that due to the action of bacteria in describing the process by which the protective influence of the inflammatory reaction is brought into play we shall assume the presence of a bacterial irritant",
"The introduction of a colony of micro-organisms is quickly followed by an accumulation of wandering cells and proliferation of connective-tissue cells in the tissues at the site of infection The various cells are attracted to the bacteria by a peculiar chemical or biological power known as chemotaxis which seems to result from variations in the surface tension of different varieties of cells probably caused by some substance produced by the micro-organisms Changes in the blood vessels then ensue the arteries becoming dilated and the rate of the current in them being for a time increased—active hyperæmia Soon however the rate of the blood flow becomes slower than normal and in course of time the current may cease stasis, and the blood in the vessels may even coagulate thrombosis. Coincidently with these changes in the vessels the leucocytes in the blood of the inflamed part rapidly increase in number and they become viscous and adhere to the vessel wall where they may accumulate in large numbers In course of time the leucocytes pass through the vessel wall—emigration of leucocytes—and move towards the seat of infection giving rise to a marked degree of local leucocytosis Through the openings by which the leucocytes have escaped from the vessels red corpuscles may be passively extruded—diapedesis of red corpuscles These processes are accompanied by changes in the endothelium of the vessel walls which result in an increased formation of lymph which transudes into the meshes of the connective tissue giving rise to an inflammatory œdema or if the inflammation is on a free surface forming an inflammatory exudate The quantity and characters of this exudate vary in different parts of the body and according to the nature virulence and location of the organisms causing the inflammation Thus it may be serous as in some forms of synovitis; sero-fibrinous as in certain varieties of peritonitis the fibrin tending to limit the spread of the inflammation by forming adhesions; croupous when it coagulates on a free surface and forms a false membrane as in diphtheria; hæmorrhagic when mixed with blood; or purulent when suppuration has occurred The protective effects of the inflammatory reaction depend for the most part upon the transudation of lymph and the emigration of leucocytes The lymph contains the opsonins which act on the bacteria and render them less able to resist the attack of the phagocytes as well as the various protective antibodies which neutralise the toxins The polymorph leucocytes are the principal agents in the process of phagocytosis p 22), and together with the other forms of phagocytes they ingest and destroy the bacteria",
"If the attempt to repel the invading organisms is successful the irritant effects are overcome the inflammation is arrested and resolution is said to take place",
"Certain of the vascular and cellular changes are now utilised to restore the condition to the normal and repair ensues after the manner already described In certain situations notably in tendon sheaths in the cavities of joints and in the interior of serous cavities for example the pleura and peritoneum the restoration to the normal is not perfect adhesions forming between the opposing surfaces",
"If however the reaction induced by the infection is insufficient to check the growth and spread of the organisms or to inhibit their toxin production local necrosis of tissue may take place either in the form of suppuration or of gangrene or the toxins absorbed into the circulation may produce blood-poisoning which may even prove fatal",
"Since the days of Celsus first century ad, heat redness swelling and pain have been recognised as cardinal signs of inflammation and to these may be added interference with function in the inflamed part and general constitutional disturbance Variations in these signs and symptoms depend upon the acuteness of the condition the nature of the causative organism and of the tissue attacked the situation of the part in relation to the surface and other factors",
"The heat of the inflamed part is to be attributed to the increased quantity of blood present in it and the more superficial the affected area the more readily is the local increase of temperature detected by the hand This clinical point is best tested by placing the palm of the hand and fingers for a few seconds alternately over an uninflamed and an inflamed area otherwise under similar conditions as to coverings and exposure In this way even slight differences may be recognised",
"Redness similarly is due to the increased afflux of blood to the inflamed part The shade of colour varies with the stage of the inflammation being lighter and brighter in the early hyperæmic stages and darker and duskier when the blood flow is slowed or when stasis has occurred and the oxygenation of the blood is defective In the thrombotic stage the part may assume a purplish hue",
"The swelling is partly due to the increased amount of blood in the affected part and to the accumulation of leucocytes and proliferated tissue cells but chiefly to the exudate in the connective tissue—inflammatory œdema The more open the structure of the tissue of the part the greater is the amount of swelling—witness the marked degree of œdema that occurs in such parts as the scrotum or the eyelids",
"Pain is a symptom seldom absent in inflammation Tenderness—that is pain elicited on pressure—is one of the most valuable diagnostic signs we possess and is often present before pain is experienced by the patient That the area of tenderness corresponds to the area of inflammation is almost an axiom of surgery Pain and tenderness are due to the irritation of nerve filaments of the part rendered all the more sensitive by the abnormal conditions of their blood supply In inflammatory conditions of internal organs for example the abdominal viscera the pain is frequently referred to other parts usually to an area supplied by branches from the same segment of the cord as that supplying the inflamed part",
"Interference with the function of the inflamed part is always present to a greater or less extent",
"Constitutional Disturbances—Under the term constitutional disturbances are included the presence of fever or elevation of temperature; certain changes in the pulse rate and the respiration; gastro-intestinal and urinary disturbances; and derangements of the central nervous system These are all due to the absorption of toxins into the general circulation",
"Temperature—A marked rise of temperature is one of the most constant and important concomitants of acute inflammatory conditions and the temperature chart forms a fairly reliable index of the state of the patient The toxins interfere with the nerve-centres in the medulla that regulate the balance between the production and the loss of body heat",
"Clinically the temperature is estimated by means of a self-registering thermometer placed for from one to five minutes in close contact with the skin in the axilla or in the mouth Sometimes the thermometer is inserted into the rectum where however the temperature is normally ¾° F higher than in the axilla",
"In health the temperature of the body is maintained at a mean of about 98.4° F (37° C by the heat-regulating mechanism It varies from hour to hour even in health reaching its maximum between four and eight in the evening when it may rise to 99° F and is at its lowest between four and six in the morning when it may be about 97° F",
"The temperature is more easily disturbed in children than in adults and may become markedly elevated (104° or 105° F from comparatively slight causes; in the aged it is less liable to change so that a rise to 103° or 104° F is to be looked upon as indicating a high state of fever",
"A sudden rise of temperature is usually associated with a feeling of chilliness down the back and in the limbs which may be so marked that the patient shivers violently while the skin becomes cold pale and shrivelled—cutis anserina This is a nervous reaction due to a want of correspondence between the internal and the surface temperature of the body and is known clinically as a rigor When the temperature rises gradually the chill is usually slight and may be unobserved Even during the cold stage however the internal temperature is already raised and by the time the chill has passed off its maximum has been reached",
"The pulse is always increased in frequency and usually varies directly with the height of the temperature Respiration is more active during the progress of an inflammation; and bronchial catarrh is common apart from any antecedent respiratory disease",
"Gastro-intestinal disturbances take the form of loss of appetite vomiting diminished secretion of the alimentary juices and weakening of the peristalsis of the bowel leading to thirst dry furred tongue and constipation Diarrhœa is sometimes present The urine is usually scanty of high specific gravity rich in nitrogenous substances especially urea and uric acid and in calcium salts while sodium chloride is deficient Albumin and hyaline casts may be present in cases of severe inflammation with high temperature The significance of general leucocytosis has already been referred to",
"General Principles of Treatment—The capacity of the inflammatory reaction for dealing with bacterial infections being limited it often becomes necessary for the surgeon to aid the natural defensive processes as well as to counteract the local and general effects of the reaction and to relieve symptoms",
"The ideal means of helping the tissues is by removing the focus of infection and when this can be done as for example in a carbuncle or an anthrax pustule the infected area may be completely excised When the focus is not sufficiently limited to admit of this the infected tissue may be scraped away with the sharp spoon or destroyed by caustics or by the actual cautery If this is inadvisable the organisms may be attacked by strong antiseptics such as pure carbolic acid",
"Moist dressings favour the removal of bacteria by promoting the escape of the inflammatory exudate in which they are washed out",
"Artificial Hyperæmia—When such direct means as the above are impracticable much can be done to aid the tissues in their struggle by improving the condition of the circulation in the inflamed area so as to ensure that a plentiful supply of fresh arterial blood reaches it The beneficial effects of hot fomentations and poultices depend on their causing a dilatation of the vessels and so inducing a hyperæmia in the affected area It has been shown experimentally that repeated short applications of moist heat not exceeding 106° F are more efficacious than continuous application It is now believed that the so-called counter-irritants—mustard iodine cantharides actual cautery—act in the same way; and the method of treating erysipelas by applying a strong solution of iodine around the affected area is based on the same principle",

"g a soft soap a very suitable soap for household use may be obtained Ribot[5] discusses this matter fully Hardened oils readily saponify may be[Pg 21] perfumed without any objections and do not impart any fishy odor to an article washed with same Meyerheim[6] states that through the use of hydrogenated oils the hardness of soap is extraordinarily raised so that soap made from hardened cottonseed oil is twelve times as hard as the soap made from ordinary cottonseed oil This soap is also said to no longer spot yellow upon aging and as a consequence of its hardness is able to contain a considerably higher content of rosin through which lathering power and odor may be improved Hardened oils can easily be used for toilet soap bases provided they are not added in too great a percentage",
"The use of hardened oils is not yet general but there is little doubt that the introduction of this process goes a long way toward solving the problem of cheaper soap material for the soap making industry",
"GREASE",
"Grease varies so greatly in composition and consistency that it can hardly be classed as a distinctive oil or fat It is obtained from refuse bones hides etc and while it contains the same constituents as tallow the olein content is considerably greater which causes it to be more liquid in composition Grease differs in color from an off-white to a dark brown The better qualities are employed in the manufacture of laundry and chip soap while the poorer qualities are only fit for the cheapest of soaps used in scrubbing floors and such purposes There is usually found in grease a considerable amount of gluey matter lime and water The percentage of free fatty acid is generally high",
"The darker grades of grease are bleached before being used This is done by adding a small quantity of sodium nitrate to the melted grease and agitating then[Pg 22] removing the excess saltpeter by decomposing with sulphuric acid A better method of refining however is by distillation The chrome bleach is also applicable",
"ROSIN COLOPHONY YELLOW ROSIN RESINA.",
"Rosin is the residue which remains after the distillation of turpentine from the various species of pines The chief source of supply is in the States of Georgia North and South Carolina It is a transparent amber colored hard pulverizable resin The better grades are light in color and known as water white w w and window glass w g. These are obtained from a tree which has been tapped for the first year As the same trees are tapped from year to year the product becomes deeper and darker in color until it becomes almost black",
"The constituents of rosin are chiefly (80-90%) abietic acid or its anhydride together with pinic and sylvic acids Its specific gravity is 1.07-1.08, melting point about 152.5 C and it is soluble in alcohol ether benzine carbon disulfide oils alkalis and acetic acid The main use of rosin outside of the production of varnishes is in the production of laundry soaps although a slight percentage acts as a binder and fixative for perfumes in toilet soaps and adds to their detergent properties Since it is mainly composed of acids it readily unites with alkaline carbonates though the saponification is not quite complete and the last portion must be completed through the use of caustic hydrates unless an excess of 10% carbonate over the theoretical amount is used A lye of 20° B is best adapted to the saponification of rosin when caustic hydrates are employed for this purpose since weak lyes cause frothing While it is sometimes considered that rosin is an adulterant for soap this is hardly justifiable as it adds to the cleansing properties of soap Soaps containing[Pg 23] rosin are of the well known yellowish color common to ordinary laundry soaps The price of rosin has so risen in the last few years that it presents a problem of cost to the soap manufacturer considering the price at which laundry soaps are sold",
"ROSIN SAPONIFICATION",
"As has been stated rosin may be saponified by the use of alkaline carbonates On account of the possibility of the soap frothing over the kettle in which the operation takes place should be set flush with the floor which ought to be constructed of cement The kettle itself is an open one with round bottom equipped with an open steam coil and skimmer pipe and the open portion is protected by a semi-circular rail A powerful grid having a 3-inch mesh covers one-half of the kettle the sharp edges protruding upwards",
"The staves from the rosin casks are removed at the edge of the kettle the rosin placed on the grid and beaten through with a hammer to break it up into small pieces",
"To saponify a ton of rosin there are required 200 lbs soda ash 1,600 lbs water and 100 lbs salt Half the water is run into the kettle boiled and then the soda ash and half the salt added The rosin is now added through the grid and the mixture thoroughly boiled As carbon dioxide is evolved by the reaction the boiling is continued for one hour to remove any excess of this gas A portion of the salt is gradually added to grain the soap well and to keep the mass in such condition as to favor the evolution of gas The remainder of the water is added to close the soap and boiling continued for one or two hours longer At this point the kettle must be carefully watched or it will boil over through the further[Pg 24] escape of carbon dioxide being hindered The mass being in a frothy condition will rapidly settle by controlling the flow of steam The remaining salt is then scattered in and the soap allowed to settle for two hours or longer The lyes are then drained off the top If the rosin soap is required for toilet soaps it is grained a second time The soap is now boiled with the water caused by the condensation of the steam which changes it to a half grained soap suitable for pumping A soap thus made contains free soda ash 0.15% or less free rosin about 15%. The mass is then pumped to the kettle containing the soap to which it is to be added at the proper stage The time consumed in thus saponifying rosin is about five hours",
"NAPHTHENIC ACIDS",
"The naphtha or crude petroleum of the various provinces in Europe as Russia Galacia Alsace and Roumania yield a series of bodies of acid character upon refining which are designated under the general name of naphthenic acids These acids are retained in solution in the alkaline lyes during the distillation of the naphtha in the form of alkaline naphthenates Upon adding dilute sulphuric acid to these lyes the naphthenates are decomposed and the naphthenic acids float to the surface in an oily layer of characteristic disagreeable odor and varying from yellow to brown in color[7]. In Russia particularly large quantities of these acids are employed in the manufacture of soap",
"The soaps formed from naphthenic acids have recently been investigated[8] and found to resemble the soaps made from cocoanut oil and palm kernel oil in that they are[Pg 25] difficult to salt out and dissociate very slightly with water The latter property makes them valuable in textile industries when a mild soap is required as a detergent e g in the silk industry These soaps also possess a high solvent power for mineral oils and emulsify very readily The mean molecular weight of naphthenic acids themselves is very near that of the fatty acids contained in cocoanut oil and like those of cocoanut oil a portion of the separated acids are volatile with steam The iodine number indicates a small content of unsaturated acids",
"That naphthenic acids are a valuable soap material is now recognized but except in Russia the soap is not manufactured to any extent at the present time",
"ALKALIS",
"The common alkali metals which enter into the formation of soap are sodium and potassium The hydroxides of these metals are usually used except in the so called carbonate saponification of free fatty acids in which case sodium and potassium carbonate are used A water solution of the caustic alkalis is known as lye and it is as lyes of various strengths that they are added to oils and fats to form soap The density or weight of a lye is considerably greater than that of water depending upon the amount of alkali dissolved and its weight is usually determined by a hydrometer This instrument is graduated by a standardized scale and while all hydrometers should read alike in a liquid of known specific gravity this is generally not the case so that it is advisable to check a new hydrometer for accurate work against one of known accuracy In this country the Baumé scale has been adopted while in England a different graduation known as the Twaddle scale is used The strength of a lye or any solution is determined by the distance the instrument[Pg 26] sinks into the solution and we speak of the strength of a solution as so many degrees Baumé or Twaddle which are read to the point where the meniscus of the lye comes on the graduated scale Hydrometers are graduated differently for liquids of different weights In the testing of lyes one which is graduated from 0° to 50° B is usually employed",
"Caustic soda is received by the consumer in iron drums weighing approximately 700 lbs each The various grades are designated as 60, 70, 74, 76 and 77%. These percentages refer to the percentage of sodium oxide Na2O in 100 parts of pure caustic soda formed by the combination of 77-1/2 parts of sodium oxide and 22-1/2 parts of water 77-1/2% being chemically pure caustic soda There are generally impurities present in commercial caustic soda These consist of sodium carbonate sodium chloride or common salt and sometimes lime It is manufactured by treating sodium carbonate in an iron vessel with calcium hydroxide or slaked lime or by electrolysis of common salt The latter process has yet been unable to compete with the former in price Formerly all the caustic soda used in soap making was imported and it was only through the American manufacturer using a similar container to that used by foreign manufacturers that they were able to introduce their product This prejudice has now been entirely overcome and most of the caustic soda used in this country is manufactured here",
"CAUSTIC POTASH",
"The output of the salts containing potassium is controlled almost entirely by Germany Formerly the chief source of supply of potassium compounds was from the burned ashes of plants but about fifty years ago the inexhaustible salt mines of Stassfurt Germany were discovered[Pg 27] The salt there mined contains besides the chlorides and sulphates of sodium magnesium calcium and other salts considerable quantities of potassium chloride and the Stassfurt mines at present are practically the entire source of all potassium compounds in spite of the fact that other localities have been sought to produce these compounds on a commercial basis especially by the United States government",
"After separating the potassium chloride from the magnesium chloride and other substances found in Stassfurt salts the methods of manufacture of caustic potash are identical to those of caustic soda In this case however domestic electrolytic caustic potash may be purchased cheaper than the imported product and it gives results equal to those obtained by the use of the imported article opinions to the contrary among soap makers being many Most of the caustic potash in the United States is manufactured at Niagara Falls by the Niagara Alkali Co and the Hooker Electrochemical Co chlorine being obtained as a by-product The latter concern employs the Townsend Cell for the manufacture of electrolytic potash and are said to have a capacity for making 64 tons of alkali daily",
"Since the molecular weight of caustic potash (56) is greater than that of caustic soda (40) more potash is required to saponify a pound of fat The resulting potash soap is correspondingly heavier than a soda soap When salt is added to a potassium soap double decomposition occurs the potassium soap being transformed to a sodium soap and the potassium uniting with the chlorine to form potassium chloride This was one of the earliest methods of making a hard soap especially in Germany where potash was derived from leeching ashes of burned wood and plants[Pg 28]",
"SODIUM CARBONATE SODA ASH.",
"While carbonate of soda is widely distributed in nature the source of supply is entirely dependent upon the manufactured product Its uses are many but it is especially important to the soap industry in the so called carbonate saponification of free fatty acids as a constituent of soap powders in the neutralization of glycerine lyes and as a filler for laundry soaps",
"The old French Le Blanc soda process which consists in treating common salt with sulphuric acid and reducing the sodium sulphate salt cake thus formed with carbon in the form of charcoal or coke to sodium sulphide which when treated with calcium carbonate yields a mixture of calcium sulphide and sodium carbonate black ash from which the carbonate is dissolved by water has been replaced by the more recent Solvay ammonia soda process Even though there is a considerable loss of salt and the by-product calcium chloride produced by this process is only partially used up as a drying agent and for refrigerating purposes the Le Blanc process cannot compete with the Solvay process so that the time is not far distant when the former will be considered a chemical curiosity In the Solvay method of manufacture sodium chloride common salt and ammonium bicarbonate are mixed in solution Double decomposition occurs with the formation of ammonium chloride and sodium bicarbonate The latter salt is comparatively difficultly soluble in water and crystallizes out the ammonium chloride remaining in solution When the sodium bicarbonate is heated it yields sodium carbonate carbon dioxide and water; the carbon dioxide is passed into ammonia which is set free from the ammonium chloride obtained as above by treatment with lime calcium oxide calcium chloride being the by-product[Pg 29]",
"Sal soda or washing soda is obtained by recrystallizing a solution of soda ash in water Large crystals of sal soda containing but 37% sodium carbonate are formed",
"POTASSIUM CARBONATE",
"Potassium carbonate is not extensively used in the manufacture of soap It may be used in the forming of soft soaps by uniting it with free fatty acids The methods of manufacture are the same as for sodium carbonate although a much larger quantity of potassium carbonate than carbonate of soda is obtained from burned plant ashes Purified potassium carbonate is known as pearl ash",
"ADDITIONAL MATERIAL USED IN SOAP MAKING",
"Water is indispensable to the soap manufacturer In the soap factory hard water is often the cause of much trouble Water which is the best solvent known in passing through the crevices of rocks dissolves some of the constituents of these and the water is known as hard This hardness is of two kinds temporary and permanent Temporarily hard water is formed by water which contains carbonic acid dissolving a portion of calcium carbonate or carbonate of lime Upon boiling the carbonic acid is driven from the water and the carbonate being insoluble in carbon dioxide free water is deposited This is the cause of boiler scale and to check this a small amount of sal ammoniac may be added to the water which converts the carbonate into soluble calcium chloride and volatile ammonium carbonate Permanent hardness is caused by calcium sulphate which is soluble in 400 parts of water and cannot be removed by boiling",
"The presence of these salts in water form insoluble lime soaps which act as inert bodies as far as their value for the common use of soap is concerned Where the percentage of lime in water is large this should be removed[Pg 30] A method generally used is to add about 5% of 20° B sodium silicate to the hard water This precipitates the lime and the water is then sufficiently pure to use",
"Salt known as sodium chloride is used to a large extent in soap making for salting out the soap during saponification as well as graining soaps Soap ordinarily soluble in water is insoluble in a salt solution use of which is made by adding salt to the soap which goes into solution and throws any soap dissolved in the lyes out of solution Salt may contain magnesium and calcium chlorides which of course are undesirable in large amounts The products on the market however are satisfactory thus no detail is necessary",
"Filling materials used are sodium silicate or water glass talc silex pumice starch borax tripoli etc",
"Besides these other materials are used in the refining of the oils and fats and glycerine recovery such as Fuller's earth bichromates of soda or potash sulphate of alumina sulphuric and hydrochloric acids and alcohol",
"A lengthy description of these substances is not given as their modes of use are detailed elsewhere",

"Construction and Equipment of a Soap Plant",
"No fixed plan for the construction and equipment of a soap plant can be given The specifications for a soap factory to be erected or remodeled must suit the particular cases Very often a building which was constructed for a purpose other than soap manufacture must be adapted for the production of soap In either case it is a question of engineering and architecture together with the knowledge obtained in practice and the final decision as to the arrangement is best solved by a conference with those skilled in each of these branches",
"An ideal soap plant is one in which the process of soap making from the melting out of the stock to the packing and shipping of the finished product moves downward from floor to floor since by this method it is possible to utilize gravitation rather than pumping liquid fats and fluid soaps Convenience and economy are obtained by such an arrangement",

"There are still more tools than those given above as you[21] doubtless know but by the time you have become workman enough to need more you will know what you need Ploughs matching-planes and all such implements are omitted because it is better and usually as cheap to get such work as they do done by machine at a mill I also assume that all your heavy sawing and planing will be done at some mill It is not worth while for the amateur to undertake the sawing and planing of large pieces the hewing and splitting of the rougher branches of wood-work for such work can be done almost anywhere by machine at very slight expense and stock can be bought already got out and planed for but a trifle more than the cost of the wood alone[6]",
"There are some cases however in which it is as well not to buy the most expensive tools at first as a cheap rule will do as well as an expensive one considering how likely you are to break or lose it and a cheap gauge will answer quite well for a good while; but this does not affect the truth of the general statement that you should get only the best tools There are also quite a number of tools appliances and makeshifts which you can make for yourselves some of which will be described I advise you not to pick up tools at second-hand shops auctions or junk shops except with the assistance of some competent workman",
"Care of Tools—Keep your tools in good order You cannot do nice fine clean work with a dull tool A sharp tool will make a clean cut but a dull edge will tear or crush the fibres and not leave a clean-cut surface You can work so much more easily and quickly as well as satisfactorily with sharp tools that the time it takes to keep them in order is much less than you lose in working with dull ones not to speak of the waste of strength and temper",
"I assume that you will not attempt to sharpen your tools yourselves until you have had considerable experience in[23] using them; for sharpening tools particularly saws and planes is very hard for boys and amateurs and not easy to learn from a book So until then be sure to have them sharpened whenever they become dull The expense is but slight and it is much better to have fewer tools kept sharp than to spend the money for more tools and have them dull When you get to the point of sharpening your tools one lesson from a practical workman or even a little time spent in watching the operations which you can do easily will help you more than reading many pages from any book So I advise you to get instruction in sharpening from some practical workman—not at first but after you have got quite handy with the tools You can easily do this at little or no expense For further points see Sharpening in Part V",
"It is a good plan to soak tool handles mallets and wooden planes when new for a week or so in raw linseed oil and then rub them with a soft rag every day or two for a while If you use wooden planes give them a good soaking They will absorb much oil and work more freely and smoothly You can save tool handles from being split by pounding by sawing the ends off square and fastening on two round disks of sole-leather in the way adopted by shoe-makers If there is any tendency to dampness in your shop the steel and iron parts of the tools should be greased with a little fat—tallow lard wax vaseline—or some anti-rust preparation",
"Use of Tools—It is very important to get started right in using tools If your first idea of what the tool is for and how it should be used is correct you will get along nicely afterwards but if you start with a wrong impression you will have to unlearn which is always hard and start afresh[24]",
"If you can learn to use your tools with either hand you will often find it a decided advantage as in getting out crooked work or particularly in carving where you have such an endless variety of cuts to be made in almost every possible direction but that is another story A bad habit and one to guard against is that of carrying with you the tool you may be using whenever you leave your work temporarily[25] instead of laying it down where you are working Edge-tools are dangerous things to carry around in the hand and there is also much chance of their being mislaid",
"For directions for using the different tools see Part V",
"Edge-Tools—Bear in mind that all cutting tools work more or less on the principle of the wedge So far as the mere cutting is concerned a keen edge is all that is required and your knife or other cutting tool might be as thin as a sheet of paper But of course such a tool would break so it must be made thicker for strength and wedge-shaped so that it may be pushed through the wood as easily as possible",
"You know that you can safely use a very thin knife to cut butter because the butter yields so easily that there is not much strain on the blade but that when you cut wood the blade must be thicker to stand the strain of being pushed through Soft wood cuts more easily than hard because it is more easily pushed aside or compressed by the wedge-shaped tool and it does not matter how keen the edge may be if the resistance of the wood is so great that you cannot force the thicker part of the tool through it",
"You will understand from all this that the more acute the angle of the cutting edge the more easily it will do its work provided always that the angle is obtuse or blunt enough to give the proper strength to the end of the tool; and also that as the end of the tool encounters more resistance in hard than soft wood the angle should be more obtuse or blunter for the former than for the latter Theoretically therefore the angle of the cutting edge to obtain the greatest possible advantage would need to be changed with every piece of wood and every kind of cut but practically all that can be done is to have a longer bevel on the tools for soft wood than for hard Experience and observation will teach these angles See Sharpening in Part V[26]",
"When you cut off a stout stick as the branch of a tree you do not try to force your knife straight across with one cut You cut a small notch and then widen and deepen it by cutting first on one side and then on the other Fig 5). The wood yields easily to the wedge on the side towards the notch so that the edge can easily cut deeper and thus the notch is gradually cut through the stick The same principle is seen in cutting down a tree with an axe You have only to look at the structure of a piece of wood when magnified as roughly indicated in Fig 6, to see why it is easier to cut with the grain than across it",
"Fig 5.",
"Fig 6.",
"Fig 7.",
"You can often cut better with a draw-stroke ie not merely pushing the tool straight ahead but drawing it across sideways at the same time Fig 7). You[27] can press the sharp edge of a knife or razor against your hand without cutting but draw the edge across and you will be cut at once Even a blade of grass will cut if you draw the edge quickly through your hand as you doubtless know",
"If you try to push a saw down into a piece of wood as you push a knife down through a lump of butter or as in chopping with a hatchet that is without pushing and pulling the saw back and forth it will not enter the wood to any extent but when you begin to work it back and forth it cuts or tears its way into the wood at once You know how much better you can cut a slice of fresh bread when you saw the knife back and forth than when you merely push it straight down through the loaf You may have noticed and you may not how much better your knife will cut and that the cut will be cleaner in doing some kinds of whittling when you draw it through the wood from handle to point Fig 7), instead of pushing it straight through in the common way and you will discover if you try cutting various substances that as a general rule the softer the material the greater the advantage in the draw-stroke",

"There should be a certain similarity of treatment between the general get-up of a book and its binding It is a great pity that printers and binders have drifted so far apart; they are or should be working for one end the production of a book and some unity of aim should be evident in the work of the two",
"The binding of manuscripts and early printed books should be strong and simple It should be as strong and durable as the original old bindings and like them last with reasonable care for four hundred years[32] or more To this end the old bindings with their stout sewing cord wooden boards and clasps may be taken as models",
"The question is constantly asked especially by women if a living can be made by setting up as bookbinders Cheap binding can most economically be done in large workshops but probably the best bindings can be done more satisfactorily by binders working alone or in very small workshops",
"If any one intends to set up as a bookbinder doing all the work without help it is necessary to charge very high prices to get any adequate return after the working expenses have been paid In order to get high prices the standard of work must be very high; and in order to attain a high enough standard of work a very thorough training is necessary It is desirable that any one hoping to make money at the craft should have at least a year’s training in a workshop where good work is done and after that some time will be spent before quite satisfactory work can be turned out rapidly enough to pay supposing that orders can be obtained or the books bound can be sold",
"There are some successful binders who[33] have had less than a year’s training but they are exceptional Those who have not been accustomed to manual work have usually in addition to the necessary skill to acquire the habit of continuous work Bookbinding seems to offer an opening for well-educated youths who are willing to serve an apprenticeship in a good shop and who have some small amount of capital at their command",
"In addition to the production of decorated bindings there is much to be done by specialising in certain kinds of work requiring special knowledge Repairing and binding early printed books and manuscripts or the restoration of Parish Registers and Accounts may be suggested",

The percentage of successes obtained at Mr Myers' house tallied very well with those obtained elsewhere One remarkable result was obtained though that had not been obtained before On one occasion the child was asked to name the suit of cards chosen one after another That is of course the child was asked to name which suit hearts diamonds clubs or spades were shown of the card drawn and seen by the committee and then thought of On this occasion the child scored a run of fourteen straight running consecutive successes The chances against this success were 4,782,969 to 1.",

"LESSON III",
"CONTACT MIND READING",
"Mind Reading is divided by the authorities into two general classes viz Contact Mind Reading and Telepathic Mind Reading",
"The first of these classes Contact Mind Reading is demonstrated by physical contact between the Transmitter or active agent and the Receiver or passive agent in order to afford an easy channel for the passage of the vibrations thought-waves nerve-currents or magnetism of the Transmitter according to the several theories favored by scientists. The second class Telepathic Mind Reading is demonstrated by the transferral of the waves vibrations currents or magnetism of the Transmitter to the Receiver over the ether through space often for thousands of miles without the more convenient wires of the nerves of the two agents",
"You will readily see that two classes of phenomena closely resemble the two classes of telegraphic phenomena ie the wire system and the wireless system There is a striking analogy between electric phenomena and mental force phenomena all the way through the subject and this subject of[Pg 25] Mind Reading is simply one of the many forms of the resemblance",
"We shall begin by giving you instructions in the first form—Contact Mind Reading as it is the simplest and most easy of accomplishment and demonstration And besides the best Telepathists have been trained by means of the practice of Contact Mind Reading at the start One leads to the other just as the ordinary wire telegraph naturally led to the wireless system which is even now but in its infancy",
"At this point we wish to point out to you a most grievous error and unjust judgment that certain so-called scientists and investigators have fallen into regarding this matter of Contact Mind Reading In order to give you a clearer idea of the nature of this error we must call your attention to the fact that Contact Mind Reading has been given much publicity through the advertisements and performances of several celebrated public performers and their lesser-light imitators",
"THE POSITIVE COLLODION PROCESS",
"In the first place we will take up for consideration the positive process",
"The first positives on glass were called ambrotypes and were the successors to the daguerreotype which they superseded and displaced by the superior facility of their production",
"For the same reason the ambrotype was succeeded by the ferrotype which was a positive collodion picture made on a thin iron plate with a black japanned surface",
"The ferrotype or tintype is now about the only product of the positive collodion process of considerable importance and is the only one that will receive consideration in these pages",
"Ferrotype plates are sold by all dealers in photographic materials; they are mostly manufactured by two large concerns in Worcester Mass p16",
"COLLODION FOR POSITIVES",
"As has before been stated to produce the finest results in positive photography requires certain modifications of the collodion bath and developer which while not unfitting them altogether for negative work yet would render them quite unsuitable for high class work",
"The formula for positive collodion here given has many merits and among those is a certain quality of film which might be termed opacity but not in the strict sense of the word; it is that quality in the film which enables it to cover up any small scratch or water mark on the surface of the plate that would infallibly spoil the picture if almost any other collodion were used",
"This quality with great clearness or transparency in the shadows and a beautiful gradation of light and shade make it unique as a positive collodion",
"There may seem to be a contradiction between the terms opacity and great transparency of shadows which may need further explanation As the shadows of a positive collodion picture are produced by the black surface of the plate showing through the collodion any defect on that portion of the surface would be expected to show very plainly and it does so with the use of the ordinary collodions sold by the dealers but not so with the collodion under consideration which may be because it is less permeable by the silver solution and that consequently the deposit of iodide of silver lies more on the surface and less within the texture of the film and is thus kept from contact with organic matter or other defects on the surface of the plate; in some such manner only can I account for a very valuable quality that has saved thousands of p17 plates that would under other usage have been thrown away",
"This formula has never before been published and must be prepared as directed",
"Alcohol and ether equal parts; gun cotton sufficient to make a moderately thick film say 5 or 6 grains to the oz; put the cotton in the ether first; when it is well saturated pour in the alcohol To which add:",
"Iodide of Ammonium  4 grains to oz",
"Iodide of Cadmium 2",
"Bromide of Cadmium  1",
"Bromide of Copper 1",
"The latter ingredient can only be had in aqueous solution I believe and requires close calculation to get at the right quantity",
"This formula gives 8 grains of salts to the ounce of collodion and would require a silver solution of 50 grains to the fluid ounce to balance properly",
"The silver solution may be prepared as per directions on page 29, under the heading—The Negative Bath",
"HOW TO COAT PLATES",
"The ferro-plate is held between the thumb and first two fingers of the left hand The collodion bottle is held in the right hand and the collodion is poured on the right upper end of the plate flowed to the left upper corner by deflecting the plate in that direction and then down the left side toward the hand and the excess run back into the bottle from the right lower corner when it has all run off the plate should be gradually brought to a perpendicular position and rocked from right to left that is perpendicular to the end p18 then to the side until the film has set or become fixed which may be ascertained by touching the film at the lower corner of the plate when if it breaks and does not run farther it has set and should without delay be immersed in the silver solution where it should remain until it has become fully sensitized which will be in from 2 to 5 minutes",
"The plate should be lowered into the bath by one continuous motion; any stoppage will cause a line and spoil the plate",
"The plate is sensitized when on removing it from the bath it presents a smooth yellowish surface; if it shows lines as of water running off a greasy surface it is not coated; return it to the bath",
"EXPOSURE OF THE PLATE",
"The plate having become sufficiently coated is taken from the bath well drained and placed in the holder or shield and a piece of glass of the same size put behind it which is to receive the pressure of the spring on the door of the holder and force the plate into its proper position evenly so that all parts will be in focus",
"The holder containing the plate is then taken to the studio or light room where the subject we will say has already been posed; the camera set and focused the exposure is then made after which it is returned to the dark room for development",
"DEVELOPER AND DEVELOPMENT",
"In the preparation of a developing solution for plate pictures we must consider that we desire to produce a picture which to be admired must have p19 pure whites clear shadows be full of detail and have an easy gradation of light and shade",
"That you may succeed in this object use the following formula and persist until you have learned its every modification:",
"DEVELOPER",
"Water 64 ounces f",
"and choose their own color scheme",
"22. Ingredients of good Paint—The best paints are usually made by mixing together white lead linseed oil pigment of the desired color colors ground in oil, and a drier",
"While white lead is sufficient as the pigment for white paint a better result is obtained by mixing zinc oxide with the white lead These two substances have the convenient property of balancing each other's disadvantages For instance zinc oxide has a tendency to crack and to peal which is overcome by the tougher coating formed by the white lead Again when white lead is exposed to light and weathering it becomes chalky which fault is remedied by the property possessed by zinc oxide of remaining hard",
"The linseed oil used is obtained from flaxseed by pressing the thoroly ground seed About twenty-three gallons of oil can be obtained from one bushel of the seed By boiling the oil with lead oxide or manganese oxide it can take more oxygen from the air and thereby its drying powers are increased",
"Driers are substances that absorb oxygen[Pg 25] from the air and give part of it to the oil The raw linseed oil absorbs the oxygen from the air very slowly but the addition of turpentine is a great aid in overcoming this defect",
"To insure the best results in painting one must first consider the kind and condition of the surface to be painted and to what use the toy will be put; then decide on the proper composition and consistency of the paint",
"23. Application of Paint—In applying the paint to the toy the first coat should be thinned This will act as a primer or undercoat for the succeeding coats of paint Care should be taken that plenty of time is allowed between coats for the paint to dry thoroly Three coats of paint will produce a good finish",
"24. Preparation of surface—All woodwork must be sanded and thoroly dry before any paint is applied Care should be taken to see that all knots and sappy streaks shall be covered with a coat of orange shellac Then apply the first coat",
"After the priming coat of paint is thoroly dry putty up all knot holes dents cracks and other defects in the surface with a pure linseed oil putty composed of equal parts of white lead and whiting When putty is dry proceed with the other coats",
"25. Tinting Materials—Formulas for making tints are to be followed only in a general way Make some allowance for slight variations in the strength and tone of different makes of colors Chromes and ochres vary noticeably Weigh out your color and add it gradually not all at once noting the effect as you go When you reach the desired shade stop regardless of what the formula calls for Turpentine and dark driers will slightly alter shades Make allowance for this",
"26. Mixing Paints—Faulty mixing even with the best of materials is not likely to make durable paint The important thing is to give the lead and oil a chance to incorporate themselves in that close union which they always make if allowed to do so The following directions give best results The order is important",
"(1) Break up the white lead with a paddle using only enough oil to bring it to the consistency of colors in oil",
"(2) Add your colors for tinting Coloring matter added after the paint has been thinned is likely to break up in lumps which leave streaks[Pg 26] when brushed out",
"(3) Put in drier",
"(4) Add remainder of oil stirring well",
"(5) Last of all put in turpentine",
"Thinners help only the flow of the paint never the quality",
"To strain paint thru cheese cloth before using will be a safeguard against lumpy colors and streakiness Paint also spreads further if strained",
"27. Paint Formulas—As most toys are exposed to the weather a great deal the following formulas are recommended These take no account of tinting materials",
"a Priming Coat:",
"25 pounds pure white lead",
"1 gallon pure raw linseed oil",
"½ gallon pure turpentine",
"¼ pint drier free from rosin",

"To twenty-five pounds of white lead ground in oil add colors in oil as follows:",
"Medium Blue Slate 3½ oz lamp black",
"Gray Blue ¼ oz lamp black",
"1 oz Prussian blue",
"¼ oz medium chrome green",
"Dark Drab 5 lbs French ochre",
"½ lb lamp black",

"Cream 5 oz French ochre",
"Sea Green 3⁄8 oz lamp black",
"½ oz medium chrome green",
"1¼ oz medium chrome yellow",
"Where tinting colors are used in sufficiently large quantities to alter the consistency of the paint add one-half as much linseed oil and turpentine by weight as you add tinting material",
"29. Enameling—When using enamel as a finish for toys care should be taken that the surface of the toy is in proper condition To obtain good results proceed as follows: Give the wood a coat of shellac Sand lightly and dust The following coat should consist of part of white paint and one part of the enamel to be used This coat should be slightly tinted with the finishing color if the finishing coat is not white Allow twenty-four hours for drying thoroly; then sand with No OO sand paper Next apply a coat of enamel of the color desired for the finished work Enamels may be tinted with colors ground in oil",
"Should the enamel not work freely add a spoonful of benzine to a gallon of enamel Turpentine may also be used as a thinner for enamel",
"A better finish of enamel consists of two coats of paint before applying the enamel This gives it a stronger body and of course makes it more durable",
"Because of its durability and for sanitary reasons enamel is the most desirable finish for toys Its glossy finish is attractive and very appealing to children[Pg 28]",
"30. The Dipping Method—When a considerable quantity of toys is to be finished the problem to be faced will be the cost of application of the paint rather than the cost of the paint itself The dipping process immersing the material to be covered is found to be the most successful especially in toy making where so many small parts are used",
"Many of the small pieces made can be subjected to the dipping process at quite a saving of time and labor with probably better results than where the application of paint or stain is done with a brush",
"The success of the dipping process depends on the arrangement adopted for holding the toys while the actual dipping is done and while they are drying Here the exercise of a little ingenuity on the part of the students and teacher will overcome most difficulties",
"Supposing that a number of checkers or handles or small wheels are to be stained A dipping frame as shown in Fig 8 could very easily be prepared You will notice the screen tray which is removable, and the tin sheet which slopes towards the container The small pieces to be stained can be handled in wire baskets with mesh just small enough so that the pieces will not fall thru",
"The wire basket is then immersed in the container and worked up and down so that the liquid will penetrate and touch all pieces It is then pulled up and swung over the screen tray where the contents of the wire basket is dumped Here the superfluous paint will drip off on the tin sheet which because of its slope will cause the superfluous paint to flow back in to the container Fig 9 shows the dipping frame in use",
"The screen tray can be removed and placed in a rack to allow for further drying Several trays could then be made and a rack to hold them could very easily be constructed",
"A DISCIPLINED SOLDIER",
"You will be expected to become quickly amenable both mentally and physically to discipline A clear conception on your part of what drills are disciplinary in character and what discipline really is will help you to become a disciplined soldier Drills executed at attention are disciplinary exercises and are designed to teach precise and soldierly movements and to inculcate that prompt and subconscious obedience which is essential to proper military control Hence all corrections should be given and received in an impersonal manner Never forget that you lose your identity as an individual when you step into ranks; you then become merely a unit of a mass As soon as you obey properly promptly and at times unconsciously the commands of your officers as soon as you can cheerfully give up pleasures and personal privileges that conflict with the new order of life to which you have submitted you will then have become a disciplined man DRESS",

Therefore be punctilious about saluting; be proud of the manner in which you execute your salute and make it indicative of discipline and good breeding Always look at the officer you are saluting The junior salutes first It is very unmilitary to salute with the left hand in a pocket or with a cigarette cigar or pipe in the mouth Observe the following general rules:",
"1. Never salute an officer when you are in ranks",
"3. Indoors armed render the prescribed salute ie the rifle salute at order arms or at trail",

"Fig 1.—Constricting a tube",
"This method of constriction is not suited to tubes much over 1⁄4 inch in diameter since the mass of glass in the constricted part becomes so thick as to be difficult to handle when hot and likely to crack on cooling Larger tubes are therefore constricted by heating in a narrow flame with constant rotation and when soft alternately gently pulling the ends apart and pushing them together each motion being so regulated that the diameter of a short section of the tube is gradually reduced while the thickness of the wall of the reduced portion remains the same as that of the rest of the tube or increases only slightly This pulling and pushing of the glass takes place in the flame while the rotation is[Pg 11] being continued regularly The result may appear as indicated in c Fig 1. The strength of the work depends upon the thickness of the walls of the constricted portion which should never be less than that in the main tube and usually a little greater This operation is most successful with tubing having a relatively thin wall",
"Flanging a Tube—This operation produces the characteristic flange seen on test-tubes necks of flasks etc the object being twofold: to finish the end neatly and to strengthen it so that a cork may be inserted without breaking it This flanging may be done in several ways In any case the first operation is to cut the tube to a square end and then heat this end so that the extreme sixteenth or eighth of an inch of it is soft and begins to shrink The tube is of course rotated during this heating which should take place in a flame of slightly greater diameter than the tube if possible The flange is now produced by expanding this softened part with some suitable tool A cone of charcoal has been recommended for this purpose and works fairly well if made so its height is about equal to the diameter of its base The tube is rotated and the cone held in the other hand is pressed into the open end until the flange is formed A pyramid with eight or ten sides would probably be better than the cone",
"Fig 2.—Flanging tool ",
"A better flanging tool is made from a triangular piece of copper or brass about 1⁄16 inch thick and mounted in a suitable handle Such a tool is shown in Fig 2, being cut from a sheet of copper and provided with a[Pg 12] handle made by wrapping asbestos paper moistened with sodium silicate solution about the shank of the tool It is well to have several sizes and shapes of these tools for different sizes of tubing The two sizes most used will be those having about the following dimensions: (1) a = 2 inches b = 1 inch; (2) a = 1 inch b = 1 inch When the end of the tube is softened the tool is inserted at an angle as indicated in Fig 3, and pressed against the soft part while the tube is quickly rotated about its axis If the flange is insufficient the operation may be repeated The tool should always be warmed in the flame before use and occasionally greased by touching it to a piece of wax or paraffin After the flange is complete the end must be heated again to the softening temperature and cooled slowly to prevent it from cracking",
"Fig 3.—Flanging a tube with flanging tool ",
"Fig 4.—Flanging a tube with carbon rod or wire ",
"Some glass-blowers use a small carbon rod about 3⁄16 inch in diameter as a flanging tool for tubes larger than about 3⁄8 inch diameter and a small iron wire or similar piece of metal for smaller tubes In this case the tube is heated as above described and the rod or wire inserted in the end at an angle and pressed against the softened part as indicated in Fig 4, while the tube is[Pg 13] rotated about its axis For large heavy tubes a larger carbon would be used",
"Rotation of the Tube—This is the fundamental manipulation in glass-blowing and upon it more than all else depends the uniformity and finish of the work and often the possibility of accomplishing the work at all Directions for it will be given on the assumption that the reader is right-handed; if otherwise the position of the hands is of course reversed The object of rotation is to insure even heating of the whole circumference of the tube at the point of attack to equalize the effect of gravity on the hot glass and prevent it from falling out of shape when soft and to keep the parts of the tube on each side of the heated portion in the same straight line",
"In rotating the tube both hands must be used so that the two ends may revolve at the same rate and the glass in the hot part not be twisted The rotation is performed by the thumb and first finger of each hand the other fingers serving to support the tube As it is almost always necessary to follow rotating and heating a tube by blowing it the hands should be so placed that it will be easy to bring the right-hand end up to the mouth without shifting the hold on the glass For this reason the left hand grasps the glass with the palm down and the right hand with the palm turned toward the left If there is any choice the longer and heavier part of the tube is usually given to the left hand and it is planned to blow into the shorter end This is because it is easier to support the tube with the hand which has the palm down This support is accomplished by bending the hand at the wrist so that it points slightly downward and then curling the second third and little fingers in under the tube which is held between them and the palm This support should be loose enough so that the thumb and first finger can easily cause the tube to rotate regu[Pg 14]larly on its axis but firm enough to carry all the weight of the tube leaving the thumb and first finger nothing to do but rotate it The hand must be so turned and the other fingers so bent that the thumb and first finger stretch out nearly to their full length to grasp the tube comfortably",
"The right hand is held with the palm toward the left the fingers except the first slightly bent and the tube held between the first finger and the thumb while it rests on the second finger and that portion of the hand between the base of the first finger and the thumb Rotation of the tube is accomplished by rolling it between the thumbs and first fingers: the rotation being continued in the same direction regularly and not reversed It is better to roll slowly and evenly with a series of light touches each of which moves the tube a little than to attempt to turn the tube a half a revolution or so with each motion of the hands The hands must be held steady and the tube must be under good control at all times so that both ends may be rotated at the same angular velocity even though they may be of different diameters and the tube be neither drawn apart nor pushed together unless such a motion is expressly desired as it sometimes is The hot part of the glass must be constantly watched to see that it is uniformly rotated and not twisted nor pulled out or pushed together more than is desired Care must also be taken to keep the parts of the tube in the same straight line or as near it as possible during the heating and all other manipulations",
"When flanging a tube it is held and rotated with the left hand as above described while the right hand holds the flanging tool",
"When part of the end of a tube must be heated as in Exercise 6, and rotation must be very carefully performed and continued during the blowing both hands are used[Pg 15] The right hand is held as above described and the left hand close to it and either as above described or else with the palm toward the right grasping the tube in the same way as the right hand does This puts both hands in a position where the tube may be blown and rotated uniformly while its axis is kept horizontal",
"Smoothness and exactness are the two things for which the beginner must constantly strive in glass-blowing and they are only attained by a careful attention to the details of manipulation with a steady hand and watchful eye Every move must count and the exercise must be finished with a minimum of reheating and retouching for the best results",

"How Incorporated—Villages are with rare exceptions incorporated under a general law specifying the number of inhabitants the mode of voting on incorporation etc",
"The method in Minnesota which may be taken as typical is as follows: Upon petition of thirty or more voters resident upon the lands to be incorporated which lands have been divided into lots and blocks the county commissioners appoint a time and give due notice thereof when the voters actually residing within the territory described may vote upon the question If a majority of those voting favor incorporation the commissioners file with the register of deeds the original petition a true copy of the notice of election and the certificate showing the result of the vote The village thus becomes incorporated and has the usual corporate powers It organizes by electing officers",
"Elective Officers—The usual elective officers of a village are a president three trustees a treasurer and a recorder who are chosen for one year and two justices of the peace and a constable elected for two years [Footnote: The difference in term is accounted for by the fact that the justices and constables are in a measure county officers]",
"The Council and Its Powers—The president the three trustees and the recorder constitute the village council They may make for the following purposes among others such ordinances or by-laws as they deem necessary:",
"1. To establish and regulate a fire department; to purchase apparatus for extinguishing fires; to construct water-works; to designate limits within which wooden buildings shall not be erected; to regulate the manner of building and cleaning chimneys and of disposing of ashes; and generally to enact such necessary measures for the prevention or extinguishment of fires as may be proper",
"2. To lay out streets alleys parks and other public grounds; to grade improve or discontinue them; to make repair improve or discontinue sidewalks and to prevent their being encumbered with merchandise snow or other obstructions; to regulate driving on the streets; to appoint a street commissioner",
"3. To erect lamp-posts and lamps and provide for the care and lighting of the lamps",
"4. To appoint a board of health with due powers; to provide public hospitals; to regulate slaughter-houses; to define prevent and abate nuisances",
"5. To establish and maintain a public library and reading-room",
"6. To prohibit gambling; to prevent or license and regulate the sale of liquor the keeping of billiard-tables and the exhibition of circuses and shows of all kinds; to appoint policemen and provide a place of confinement for offenders against the ordinances",
"7.

"All fines and penalties imposed belong to the village",
"Vacancies and Removals—Vacancies in any of the village offices are filled by the council and it has power to remove any officer elected or appointed by it whenever it seems that the public welfare will be promoted thereby",
"Elections—A village usually constitutes one election district and one road district Village elections are conducted as are those in a town",
"Enlargements—Lands adjoining the village may be annexed to it at the wish and with the consent of the voters of the territory and of the village The will of the voters aforesaid is expressed at an election called after due notice by the county commissioners",

"CHAPTER V",
"THE CITY",
"Need Of—A village being one election district has only one polling place The community may increase so in numbers as to make it necessary to have several voting places For the accommodation of the people these would naturally be located in different parts of the community; and to prevent fraud voting precincts would have to be carefully defined The council would naturally be made up of representatives from these divisions",
"When under this arrangement the voters assemble in different parts of the community they could not listen to financial reports and vote taxes as they do in the town and the village Hence it would be necessary to endow the council with increased powers including the power to levy taxes without the direct authorization of the people",
"The expenses for public improvements for waterworks sewers street-lighting etc may take more money than it would be prudent to assess upon the community for immediate payment In this case it would be desirable for the community to have the power to issue bonds",
"Again with increase in population there is an increase in the number of disputes over private rights and temptations to crime become more numerous Hence the need of one or more courts having jurisdiction greater than that possessed by justices of the peace The conditions necessitate also an increase in the number and the efficiency of the police And to render the police efficient it is necessary that they be under the direction of one man the same one who is responsible for the carrying out of the ordinances of the council namely the mayor",
"A community organized to comply with the foregoing requirements—divided into wards having a council made up of aldermen from those wards having a council authorized to levy taxes at its discretion having a municipal court having regularly employed police acting under the direction of the mayor—is a city as the term is generally used in the United States",
"Another reason for establishing a city government is frequently potent although unmentioned The pride of the community can be thereby indulged and more citizens can have their ambition to hold public office gratified",
"How Organized—A city may be organized under general law or special charter from the legislature Large cities and small ones with great expectations usually work under a charter But the custom is growing of organizing cities at first under general law Then if a city outgrows the general law grows so that it needs powers and privileges not granted therein it may properly ask the legislature for a special charter",
"As a type the principal provisions of the general law of Minnesota are here given as follows:",
"The usual elective officers of a city are a mayor a treasurer a recorder one justice of the peace for each ward styled city justice all of whom shall be qualified voters of the city and one or more aldermen for each ward who shall be qualified voters therein All other city officers are appointed",
"The term of mayor city justices and aldermen is in most states two years; that of the other officers one year",
"A vacancy in the office of mayor or alderman is filled by a new election A vacancy in any other office is filled by appointment The person elected or appointed serves for the unexpired term",
"The City Council consists of the aldermen [Footnote: In some states the city council consists of two bodies] It is the judge of the election of its own members A majority of the members elected constitutes a quorum for the transaction of business",
"The council chooses its own president and vice-president In case the mayor is absent from the city or for any reason is temporarily unable to act the president of the council acts as mayor with the title Acting Mayor",
"Publication of Ordinances—The ordinances and by-laws of the council are published in a newspaper of the city selected by the council as the official means of publication and are posted in three conspicuous places in each ward for two weeks before they become operative",
"Council Powers—The city council has about the same powers as a village council in regard to streets the prevention and extinguishment of fires etc—the same in kind but somewhat more extensive But it can also levy taxes for public purposes as has before been said It usually elects the assessor the city attorney the street commissioner and a city surveyor and in some states other officers",

"Resolved That for a community of 5000 inhabitants or less a village organization is better than a city organization",
"CHAPTER VI",
"THE COUNTY",
"Need Of—A county organization is needed for the following reasons:",
"1. To establish the lower organizations As we have seen the organizations within the county are established by county officers But it may properly be asked why not have them organized by the state directly? There are at least three good reasons: In the first place it would be too burdensome to the state; that is the state would act through the legislature and to organize all the individual school districts towns villages and cities would take up too much of the time of the legislature In the second place the organizing could only be done at certain times namely during the session of the legislature and in the meantime communities would have to wait In the third place the records of incorporation would be inaccessible in case they were needed for reference",
"2. To serve as a medium between the state and the lower organizations The state uses the town village and city to value property for purposes of taxation and as election districts But it gets its taxes and its election returns through the county Here again may arise the question why not send the state taxes directly to the capital and make election returns directly also? At least two good reasons appear: It would increase the work and therefore the number of officials at the capital and if a mistake should be made it could not be so easily discovered and corrected",
"3. To carry on public works beyond the power of the towns individually A desired local improvement may be beyond the power of a town either because it is outside of the jurisdiction of the town or because of its expense Thus a road may be needed between two centers of population villages or cities which would run through several towns while the jurisdiction of the towns individually extends only to their own borders Or a bridge over a wide stream may be needed which would be too expensive for the town in which it is located The road and the bridge would better be provided by the county[Footnote: Sometimes state aid is secured Do you think it wise as a rule for the state to grant such aid?] And the poor can generally be better cared for by the county than by the individual towns for the county can erect and maintain a poor-house",
"4. To secure certain local officers not needed in every town; for instance a register of deeds the coroner the judge of probate the superintendent of schools in most states, and the surveyor",
"5. To serve as a territorial basis for the apportionment of members of the legislature This is perhaps merely an incidental gain But its convenience in defining legislative districts is obvious",
"6. To make justice cheap and accessible It is well in many ways as we have seen to have in every town village and city courts of limited jurisdiction But to establish justice in any generous or satisfying sense there should be within the reach of every citizen a court competent to try any difference between individuals regardless of the amount in controversy and able to punish any crime against the laws of the state To bring such a court within the reach of every one was the original reason for the establishment of the county and remains today the greatest advantage derived from its existence",
"Establishment—Counties are established by the state legislature",
"In thinly settled parts of a state the counties are much larger than in the populous parts A county should be large enough to make its administration economical and yet small enough to bring its seat of justice within easy reach of every one within its boundaries In the ideal county a person living in any part thereof can go to the county seat by team have several hours for business and return home the same day",
"County Board—The administration of county affairs is in the hands of the county commissioners or supervisors This board is usually constructed on one of two plans: Either it consists of three or five members the county being divided into commissioner districts; or else it is constituted of the chairmen or other member of each of the several town boards The former plan prevails in Minnesota Iowa and other states; the latter in Wisconsin Michigan most of Illinois and in other states",
"The commissioners have charge of county roads and bridges county buildings and other county property and the care of the county poor Through the commissioners the county exercises the usual corporate powers",
"1. The selection of an honest man for the office so far as possible is a prime consideration",
"2. The treasurer must give a bond for such amount as the county commissioners direct",
"5. The books must be balanced at the close of each day",
"6. When any money is paid to the county treasurer excepting that paid on taxes charged on duplicate the treasurer shall give to the person paying the same duplicate receipts therefor one of which such persons shall forthwith deposit with the county auditor in order that the county treasurer may be charged with the amount thereof",
"7. The county auditor the chairman of the board of county commissioners and the clerk of the district court acting as an auditing board carefully examine at least three times a year the accounts books and vouchers of the county treasurer and count the money in the treasury",
"8. The state examiner makes a similar examination at least once a year No notice is given in either case",
"9. As security against robbers the money in the possession of the county treasurer must be deposited on or before the first of every month in one or more banks The banks are designated by the auditing board and must give bonds for twice the amount to be deposited",
"At a time in early English history when the only county officers were the sheriff and the coroner the coroner acted as sheriff when the latter was for any reason incapacitated And the practice still continues Thus if there is a vacancy in the office of sheriff the coroner acts till a new sheriff is chosen And in most states the coroner is the only officer who can serve process upon the sheriff or who can arrest him",
"Election and Term—The county officers are in most sections of the country elected by the people of the county The term is usually two years",
"Compensation—Compensation is usually by salary or by fees The matter is usually in the hands of the county commissioners except so far as concerns their own compensation which is fixed by law This is usually a per diem",
"Eligibility—Any voter who has resided in the county a certain time usually about thirty days is eligible to any county office except that of attorney or court commissioner The former must be a person admitted to practice in all the courts of the state The latter must be a man learned in the law",
"In some cases a person may hold two offices at the same time; thus a person may be court commissioner and judge of probate But no person can hold two offices one of which is meant to be a check upon the other For instance no one could be auditor and treasurer at the same time In some states there is a bar against holding certain offices for two terms in succession",

"L ITHOGRAPHY Of these methods of printing lithography is the outstanding example: it is a method of reproduction possessed of great possibilities for by its employment a facsimile of any drawing can be obtained",
"As a means of artistic expression it ranks high amongst the graphic arts and for the reproduction of drawings of a scientific nature it is very popular since it meets most requirements and is comparatively inexpensive",
"The art which was discovered by Senefelder towards the end of the eighteenth century depends on the fact that grease and water are immiscible: a drawing made with a greasy pigment upon a suitable surface adheres very strongly whilst those parts free from it retain water so that when damped and rolled up ie inked, the ink used will stick only to the lines etc of the drawing but not to the other parts",
"Clearly the surface is all important and this is provided by lithographic stone a limestone occurring in Germany France England and Canada The best stones occur at Solenhofen near Munich those from other localities being inferior in quality Incidentally it may be mentioned that zinc and aluminium plates are not infrequently used in place of stone",
"Lithographic stones vary in hardness colour and grain For the best work the stone should be homogeneous and of a hardness suitable for the subject; the colour affords an indication of the hardness the lighter-coloured stones which are much the commoner being softer than the darker",
"There are two modes of procedure; the drawing may page 16 be made direct on the stone with lithographic ink or crayon—both being mixtures of tallow wax soap and shellac with a sufficiency of pigment to render the drawing visible to the artist—or else the drawing may be made upon transfer paper",
"The former method although the more satisfactory and often used by artists is seldom pursued in scientific drawings except when professional draughtsmen are employed In such cases it may be necessary to reverse the drawing which is conveniently done by viewing it in a mirror and of course all lettering must be reversed",
"The majority of amateur draughtsmen make their drawings in pencil or ink and these the lithographer traces upon lithographic transfer paper and transfers them to the stone; he the lithographer may merely trace the salient features and work the drawing up on the stone The transfer papers are coated with gelatine starch or gum or mixtures of these substances the idea being to interpose between the real paper and the pigment—in the form of lithographic crayon or ink—some substance soluble in water which will hold the pigment and prevent it soaking into the paper so that a transfer has only to be damped through the back pressed on to the stone and peeled off The work together with more or less of the film will thus be transferred on to the stone and of course will be reversed since the part uppermost on the stone will be the back of the original drawing",
"The original drawings may be made upon the transfer paper direct and in so doing mistakes in tracing will be obviated Suitable papers are made for various purposes eg smooth for ink work and variously granulated for crayon see Plate 1, which was drawn by Mr Harry Becker on transfer paper.",
"Another advantage in drawing directly upon the transfer paper is that the draughtsman can make corrections page 17 pretty easily for if needs be a bad piece of work can be entirely cut out and a fresh piece of paper inserted",
"Assuming that the transfer method has been employed the stone must be prepared according as the drawing is made with ink or with crayon",
"The stone is first thoroughly ground in order to rid it of all traces of previous work and then polished for ink work or grained—ie roughened—for crayon work the small points produced taking up the crayon in proportion to the amount present on the transfer and the pressure used",
"The transfer is then damped with water sometimes with a dilute solution of nitric acid and placed in position on the stone which is then passed two or three times through the lithographic press until dry Then the back of the paper is damped and the sheet peeled off",
"The stone is next proved ie prepared for printing",
"It is first carefully examined for broken lines and other blemishes which are touched up with ink or crayon The stone is then painted over with a solution of gum in water which is allowed to dry it is then washed in water and rolled up with ink The drawing will now be clearly visible for if properly inked the clear parts of the stone will not take the pigment so that any parts which require cleaning up may be deleted This is accomplished by means of a pencil of snake stone a piece of pumice stone an acid stump—a rod of hard wood the sharpened end of which is dipped into nitric acid—or with a scraper The stone is again washed and rolled up strongly with ink and etched with a dilute solution of nitric acid which is applied with a sponge; then the surface is again gummed and the stone allowed to dry It is sometimes necessary to re-etch the stone; if so the damp stone is rolled up with thin ink and allowed to dry it is then dusted over with finely powdered resin the superfluous resin is removed by means of a wet sponge and the surface is page 18 painted over with a solution of gum arabic mixed with dilute nitric acid If the resin is well incorporated with the ink the work will suffer no damage in the process The acid gum is then dabbed off with a rag the stone is cleaned up with turpentine rolled up once more gummed and finally set aside to dry",
"All this appears complicated but it is very necessary to get a good surface for printing The action of the gum does not appear to be clearly understood the nitric acid obviously will etch the stone so that the gum will easily penetrate It is sometimes supposed that the arabic acid of the gum enters into a chemical composition with the calcium carbonate making a film which is the real ink-resisting surface This film has not a long life so that in printing it is necessary to renew it periodically by the application of gum solution",
"If possible the stone should be allowed to rest for a day or two after proving in order that the ink may sink well in",

"If you have a modem with its own on-board circuitry or an external modem you should have no trouble at all",
"On GNU/Linux systems the serial ports are referred to as /dev/ttyS0, /dev/ttyS1, and so on Your modem is almost certainly connected to either port 0 or port 1, equivalent to COM1: and COM2: under Windows If you don't know which your modem is connected to run the program wvdialconf to try to detect it see below; otherwise just try both and see which works",

"This section describes how to mount a floppy or Zip disk discusses the /dev directory and addresses distributing the directory tree over multiple physical devices or partitions",
"Mounting a Filesystem",
"On a GNU/Linux system there's no necessary correspondence between directories and physical devices as there is in Windows in which each drive has its own directory tree beginning with a letter such as C:\).",
"Instead each physical device such as a hard disk or floppy disk has one or more filesystems on it In order to make a filesystem accessible it's assigned to a particular directory in another filesystem To avoid circularity the root filesystem which contains the root directory /) is not stored within any other filesystem You have access to it automatically when you boot Debian",
"A directory in one filesystem that contains another filesystem is known as a mount point A mount point is a directory in a first filesystem on one device such as your hard disk that ``contains'' a second filesystem perhaps on another device such as a floppy disk. To access a filesystem you must mount it at some mount point",
"So for example you might mount a CD at the mount point /cdrom This means that if you look in the directory /cdrom you'll see the contents of the CD The /cdrom directory itself is actually on your hard disk For all practical purposes the contents of the CD become a part of the root filesystem and when you type commands and use programs it doesn't make any difference what the actual physical location of the files is You could have created a directory on your hard disk called /cdrom and put some files in it and everything would behave in exactly the same way Once you mount a filesystem there's no need to pay any attention to physical devices",
"However before you can mount a filesystem or actually create a filesystem on a disk that doesn't have one yet it's necessary to refer to the devices themselves All devices have names which are located in the /dev directory If you type ls /dev now you'll see a pretty lengthy list of every possible device you could have on your Debian system For a summary of some devices see Table 2.1 on page [*]. A more thorough list can be found on your system in the file /usr/src/linux/Documentation/devicestxt",
"To mount a filesystem we want to tell Linux to associate whatever filesystem it finds on a particular device with a particular mount point In the process we might have to tell Linux what kind of filesystem to look for",
"Example: Mounting a CD-ROM",
"As a simple demonstration we'll go through mounting a CD-ROM such as the one you may have used to install Debian You'll need to be root to do this so be careful; whenever you're root you have the power to manipulate the whole system not just your own files Also these commands assume there's a CD in your drive; you should put one in the drive now Then start with the following command: su",

"The -t option specifies the type of the filesystem in this case iso9660. Most CDs are iso9660. The next argument is the name of the device to mount and the final argument is the mount point There are many other arguments for mount; see the manual page for details",

"/etc/fstab: Automating the Mount Process",
"The file /etc/fstab it stands for ``filesystem table'') contains descriptions of filesystems that you mount often These filesystems can then be mounted with a shorter command such as mount /cdrom You can also configure filesystems to mount automatically when the system boots You'll probably want to mount all of your hard disk filesystems when you boot so Debian automatically adds entries to fstab to do this for you",

"The fifth column is used by the dump utility to decide when to back up the filesystem In most cases you can put 0 here",

"CHAPTER V",
"IMPLEMENTS AND THEIR USES",
"This is true of the small garden as certainly as of the large one: in fact in proportion I am not sure but that it is more so—because of the second wonderful thing about modern garden tools that is the low prices at which they can be bought considering the enormous percentage of labor saved in accomplishing results There is nothing in the way of expense to prevent even the most modest gardener acquiring during a few years by the judicious expenditure of but a few dollars annually a very complete outfit of tools that will handsomely repay their cost",
"While some garden tools have been improved and developed out of all resemblance to their original forms others have changed little in generations and in probability will remain ever with us There is a thing or two to say about even the simplest of them however— especially to anyone not familiar with their uses",
"There are tools for use in every phase of horticultural operations; for preparing the ground for planting the seed for cultivation for protecting crops from insects and disease and for harvesting",
"First of all comes the ancient and honorable spade which for small garden plots borders beds etc must still be relied upon for the initial operation in gardening—breaking up the soil There are several types but any will answer the purpose In buying a spade look out for two things: see that it is well strapped up the handle in front and back and that it hangs well In spading up ground especially soil that is turfy or hard the work may be made easier by taking a strip not quite twice as wide as the spade and making diagonal cuts so that one vertical edge of the spade at each thrust cuts clean out to where the soil has already been dug The wide-tined spading-fork is frequently used instead of the spade as it is lighter and can be more advantageously used to break up lumps and level off surfaces In most soils it will do this work as well if not better than the spade and has the further good quality of being serviceable as a fork too thus combining two tools in one It should be more generally known and used With the ordinary fork used for handling manure and gathering up trash weeds etc every gardener is familiar The type with oval slightly up-curved tines five or six in number and a D handle is the most convenient and comfortable for garden use",
"For areas large enough for a horse to turn around in use a plow There are many good makes The swivel type has the advantage of turning all the furrows one way and is the best for small plots and sloping ground It should turn a clean deep furrow In deep soil that has long been cultivated plowing should with few exceptions be down at least to the subsoil; and if the soil is shallow it will be advisable to turn up a little of the subsoil at each plowing—not more than an inch—in order that the soil may gradually be deepened In plowing sod it will be well to have the plow fitted with a coulter which turns a miniature furrow ahead of the plowshare thus covering under all sods and grass and getting them out of the way of harrows and other tools to be used later In plowing under tall-growing green manures like rye a heavy chain is hung from the evener to the handle thus pulling the crop down into the furrow so that it will all be covered under Where drainage is poor it will be well to break up the subsoil with a subsoil plow which follows in the wake of the regular plow but does not lift the subsoil to the surface",
"TOOLS FOR PREPARING THE SEED-BED",
"The spade or spading-fork will be followed by the hoe or hook and the iron rake; and the plow by one or more of the various types of harrow The best type of hoe for use after the spade is the wide deep-bladed type In most soils however this work may be done more expeditiously with the hook or prong-hoe see illustration. With this the soil can be thoroughly pulverized to a depth of several inches In using either be careful not to pull up manure or trash turned under by the spade as all such material if left covered will quickly rot away in the soil and furnish the best sort of plant food I should think that our energetic manufactures would make a prong-hoe with heavy wide blades like those of the spading-fork but I have never seen such an implement either in use or advertised",
"What the prong-hoe is to the spade the harrow is to the plow For general purposes the Acme is an excellent harrow It is adjustable and for ground at all mellow will be the only one necessary; set it for the first time over to cut in deep; and then set for leveling it will leave the soil in such excellent condition that a light hand- raking or for large areas the Meeker smoothing-harrow will prepare it for the finest of seeds such as onions and carrots The teeth of the Acme are so designed that they practically constitute a gang of miniature plows Of disc harrows there are a great many makes The salient feature of the disc type is that they can tear up no manure grass or trash even when these are but partly turned under by the plow For this reason it is especially useful on sod or other rough ground The most convenient harrow for putting on the finishing touches for leveling off and fining the surface of the soil is the lever spike-tooth It is adjustable and can be used as a spike-tooth or as a smoothing harrow",
"Any of the harrows mentioned above except the Meeker and likewise the prong-hoe will have to be followed by the iron rake when preparing the ground for small-seeded garden vegetables Get the sort with what is termed the bow head see illustration instead of one in which the head is fastened directly to the end of the handle It is less likely to get broken and easier to use There is quite a knack in manipulating even a garden rake which will come only with practice Do not rake as though you were gathering up leaves or grass The secret in using the garden rake is not to gather things up Small stones lumps of earth and such things you of course wish to remove Keep these raked off ahead of where you are leveling the soil which is accomplished with a backward-and-forward movement of the rake",
"The tool-house of every garden of any size should contain a seed-drill Labor which is otherwise tedious and difficult is by it rendered mere play—as well as being better done The operations of marking the row opening the furrow dropping the seed at the proper depth and distance covering immediately with fresh earth and firming the soil are all done at one fell swoop and as fast as you can walk It will even drop seeds in hills But that is not all: it may be had as part of a combination machine which after your seeds are planted—with each row neatly rolled on top and plainly visible—may be at once transformed into a wheel hoe that will save you as much time in caring for your plants as the seed-drill did in planting your seed Hoeing drudgery becomes a thing of the past The illustration herewith shows such a machine and some of the varied attachments which may be had for it There are so many and so varied in usefulness that it would require an entire chapter to detail their special advantages and methods of use The catalogues describing them will give you many valuable suggestions; and other ways of utilizing them will discover themselves to you in your work",
"Valuable as the wheel hoe is however and varied in its scope of work the time-tried hoe cannot be entirely dispensed with An accompanying photograph [ED Not shown here] shows four distinct types all of which will pay for themselves in a garden of moderate size The one on the right is the one most generally seen; next to it is a modified form which personally I prefer for all light work such as loosening soil and cutting out weeds It is lighter and smaller quicker and easier to handle Next to this is the Warren or heart-shaped hoe especially valuable in opening and covering drills for seed such as beans peas or corn The scuffle-hoe or scarifier which completes the four is used between narrow rows for shallow work such as cutting off small weeds and breaking up the crust It has been rendered less frequently needed by the advent of the wheel hoe but when crops are too large to admit of the use of the latter the scuffle-hoe is still an indispensable time-saver",
"There remains one task connected with gardening that is a bug-bear That is hand-weeding To get down on one's hands and knees in the blistering hot dusty soil with the perspiration trickling down into one's eyes and pick small weedlets from among tender plantlets is not a pleasant occupation There are however several sorts of small weeders which lessen the work considerably One or another of the common types will seem preferable according to different conditions of soil and methods of work Personally I prefer the Lang's for most uses The angle blade makes it possible to cut very near to small plants and between close-growing plants while the strap over the back of a finger or thumb leaves the fingers free for weeding without dropping the instrument",
"There are two things to be kept in mind about hand-weeding which will reduce this work to the minimum First never let the weeds get a start; for even if they do not increase in number if they once smother the ground or crop you will wish you had never heard of a garden Second do your hand-weeding while the surface soil is soft when the weeds come out easily A hard-crusted soil will double and treble the amount of labor required",
"It would seem that it should be needless when garden tools are such savers of labor to suggest that they should be carefully kept always bright and clean and sharp and in repair But such advice is needed to judge by most of the tools one sees",
"Always have a piece of cloth or old bag on hand where the garden tools are kept and never put them away soiled and wet Keep the cutting edges sharp There is as much pleasure in trying to run a dull lawnmower as in working with a rusty battered hoe Have an extra handle in stock in case of accident; they are not expensive In selecting hand tools always pick out those with handles in which the grain does not run out at the point where there will be much strain in using the tool In rakes hoes etc get the types with ferrule and shank one continuous piece so as not to be annoyed with loose heads",
"Spend a few cents to send for some implement catalogues They will well repay careful perusal even if you do not order this year In these days of intensive advertising the commercial catalogue often contains matter of great worth in the gathering and presentation of which no expense has been spared",

"This exercise is most easily learned on tubing with an exterior diameter of 1⁄4 inch or a little less having moderately heavy walls A piece of such tubing is heated before the blow-pipe at a point ten or twelve inches from the end and there drawn out to a capillary as previously described page 9). The capillary is sealed off about two inches from the main tube and the latter is cut near the middle Care should be taken to get square ends[Pg 17] where the cut is made page 7). The flame is now so regulated that it is a little broader than the diameter of the tube the sealed half of the tube taken in the left hand and the other half in the right The open end of the sealed part and one of the ends of the other part are now held in opposite sides of the flame inclined at a slight angle to one another as indicated in Fig 5, and rotated and heated until the surfaces of both ends are just softened The two ends are then carefully and quickly brought together a Fig 6), removed from the flame and pulled apart a little to reduce the lump formed at the joint as much as possible as indicated in b The joint is then tested by blowing into the open end of the tube to see if it is tight If so the flame is reduced to half or less than half of its former size and the joint heated in it holding the tube and continually rotating it as directed in the last chapter page 13).",

"The paint used for dipping purposes must so be prepared that too much does not run off or too much stay on for this is surely one way to spoil the work It should be thinned to the right consistency and care should be taken that the thinners used are of the best quality",
"Where larger pieces of work are to be dipped wire attachments could be devised and each part hung separately over the dipping frame until ready to be placed in a rack If the wire[Pg 29] attachment forms a hook on one end it will be possible to hang up the toy until drained and dried In removing the toy from the paint it should be drawn out very slowly so that the surface of the paint may be left as smooth as possible",
"Where one desires line effects on toys these may be lined in afterwards with a small size striping brush or sign painter's pencil",

"Alcoholic solution of tannin 10 grains to the ounce  4",
"The four ounces of iron should be dissolved in the sixty-four ounces fluid of water and the acetic acid and tannic alcohol added",
"In using this solution develop your plate over a large filter which will receive all your surplus developing solution and conduct it into a bottle for use again; drain the plate into this filter before washing wash carefully and then place it into the fixing solution—the developing solution which has filtered through into the bottle is afterwards used in the proportion of one-half of old to one-half of the new or fresh solution This greatly improves the high lights of the picture and by using more or less of the old solution effects can be produced that are impossible by any other means",
"Great care should be taken to cause the developing solution to flow evenly and with one sweep as it were over the whole surface so that the action may be as near as possible equal on all parts of the surface",
"In a very few seconds after the action of the developer has commenced the picture will show up The plate meanwhile should be kept in motion and the p20 solution caused to flow from side to side and from one end to the other in order that the development may progress evenly and with the same speed on all parts",
"The picture will gradually grow and brighten until all the detail that might be expected is seen in the shadows; then pour off the remaining solution into the filter and proceed to wash the plate until all traces of greasiness disappear; when the plate is sufficiently washed and is ready to be fixed or cleared Another developing solution is prepared as follows:",
"Make a 64-ounce saturated solution of protosulphate of iron into which drop tannin solution enough to cause a precipitate which remains undissolved after shaking then add drop by drop pure nitric acid until the precipitate is taken up and the solution becomes clear To one ounce of this add water until it tests 18 to 20 grains to the ounce by the hydrometer then add one ounce acetic acid which perfects the formula and constitutes the developer",
"The truth is that the muscles have nothing to do with the passage of the mental currents or waves from the Transmitter to the Receiver any more than they have to do with the transmission of nervous sensations from body to brain or the motor impulses from brain to body When you wish to close your hand you send a nervous current from your brain to the muscles controlling your hand The current travels along the nervous system and is by it distributed over the muscles causing them to contract A current from a galvanic battery will cause the muscles to act in the same way But the muscle is the machinery affected and set into motion and the nerves are the delicate telegraphic wires leading to the parts[Pg 28] ENTERING",

"Now put the sharpest edge-tool you can find under a powerful microscope and you will see that the edge instead of being so very smooth is really quite ragged—a sort of saw-like edge Then look at the structure of a piece of wood as roughly indicated in Fig 6, and you will understand at once just what we do when we cut wood with an edge-tool You see the microscopically small sticks or tubes or bundles of woody fibre of which the big stick is composed and you also see the microscopically fine saw to cut them Now if the edge of the tool is fine you can often do the work satisfactorily by simply pushing the tool straight through the wood but do you not see that if you can draw or slide[28] the tool either back or forth the edge being saw-like will do its work better?",
"This stroke cannot be used of course in chopping with the axe or hatchet splitting kindling-wood or splitting a stick with the grain with a knife or chisel In these operations the main principle is that of the wedge pure and simple driven through by force the keen edge merely starting the cut after which the wedge does the rest of the work by bearing so hard against the wood at the sides of the cut that it forces it to split in advance of the cutting edge as in riving a log by the use first of an axe then of an iron wedge and finally a large wooden wedge Fig 8).",

"The various machinery and other equipment for soap manufacture are well known to those connected with this industry It varies of course depending upon the kind of soap to be manufactured and full descriptions of the necessary machinery are best given in the catalogs issued by the manufacturers of such equipment who in this country are most reliable",
"To know just what equipment is necessary can very easily be described by a brief outline of the process various soaps undergo to produce the finished article After the saponification has taken place in the soap kettle the molten soap is run directly into the soap frames[Pg 32] which consist of an oblong compartment holding anywhere from 400 to 1,200 pounds with removable steel sides and mounted upon trucks in which it solidifies In most cases it is advisable to first run the soap into a crutcher or mixer which produces a more homogeneous mass than if this operation is omitted Color and perfume may also be added at this point although when a better grade of perfume is added it must be remembered that there is considerable loss due to volatilization of same When a drying machine is employed the molten soap is run directly upon the rollers of this machine later adding about 1.0% zinc oxide to the soap from which it passes continuously through the drying chamber and is emitted in chip form ready for milling After the soap has been framed it is allowed to cool and solidify which takes several days and then the sides of the frame are stripped of",
"Bier's Constricting Bandage—To induce a passive hyperæmia in a limb an elastic bandage is applied some distance above the inflamed area sufficiently tightly to obstruct the venous return from the distal parts without arresting in any way the inflow of arterial blood Fig 6). If the constricting band is correctly applied the parts beyond become swollen and œdematous and assume a bluish-red hue but they retain their normal temperature the pulse is unchanged and there is no pain If the part becomes blue cold or painful or if any existing pain is increased the band has been applied too tightly The hyperæmia is kept up from twenty to twenty-two hours out of the twenty-four and in the intervals the limb is elevated to get rid of the œdema and to empty it of impure blood and so make room for a fresh supply of healthy blood when the bandage is re-applied As the inflammation subsides the period during which the band is kept on each day is diminished; but the treatment should be continued for some days after all signs of inflammation have subsided",

"INSTRUCTIONS FOR USING A SLIDE RULE",
"The slide rule is a device for easily and quickly multiplying dividing",
"and extracting square root and cube root It will also perform any",
"combination of these processes On this account it is found extremely",
"useful by students and teachers in schools and colleges by engineers",
"architects draftsmen surveyors chemists and many others Accountants",
"and clerks find it very helpful when approximate calculations must be",
"made rapidly The operation of a slide rule is extremely easy and it is",
"well worth while for anyone who is called upon to do much numerical",
"calculation to learn to use one It is the purpose of this manual to",
"explain the operation in such a way that a person who has never before",
"used a slide rule may teach himself to do so",
"DESCRIPTION OF SLIDE RULE",
"The slide rule consists of three parts see figure 1). B is the body of",
"the rule and carries three scales marked A D and K S is the slider",
"which moves relative to the body and also carries three scales marked B",
"CI and C R is the runner or indicator and is marked in the center with",
"a hair-line The scales A and B are identical and are used in problems",
"involving square root Scales C and D are also identical and are used",
"for multiplication and division Scale K is for finding cube root Scale",
"CI or C-inverse is like scale C except that it is laid off from right",
"to left instead of from left to right It is useful in problems",
"involving reciprocals MULTIPLICATION",
"We will start with a very simple example:",
"Example 1:  2 * 3 = 6",
"To prove this on the slide rule move the slider so that the 1 at the",
"left-hand end of the C scale is directly over the large 2 on the D scale",
"see figure 1). Then move the runner till the hair-line is over 3 on the",
"C scale Read the answer 6, on the D scale under the hair-line Now",
"let us consider a more complicated example:",
"Example 2:   2.12 * 3.16 = 6.70",
"As before set the 1 at the left-hand end of the C scale which we will",
"call the left-hand index of the C scale over 2.12 on the D scale See",
"figure 2). The hair-line of the runner is now placed over 3.16 on the C",
"scale and the answer 6.70, read on the D scale",
"METHOD OF MAKING SETTINGS",
"[This 6 inch rule uses fewer minor divisions]",
"In order to understand just why 2.12 is set where it is figure 2),",
"notice that the interval from 2 to 3 is divided into 10 large or major",
"divisions each of which is of course equal to one-tenth (0.1) of the",
"amount represented by the whole interval The major divisions are in",
"turn divided into 5 small or minor divisions each of which is one-fifth",
"or two-tenths (0.2) of the major division that is 0.02 of the",
"whole interval Therefore the index is set above",
"2 + 1 major division + 1 minor division = 2 + 0.1 + 0.02 = 2.12.",
"In the same way we find 3.16 on the C scale While we are on this",
"subject notice that in the interval from 1 to 2 the major divisions are",
"marked with the small figures 1 to 9 and the minor divisions are 0.1 of",
"the major divisions In the intervals from 2 to 3 and 3 to 4 the minor",
"divisions are 0.2 of the major divisions and for the rest of the D or",
"C scale the minor divisions are 0.5 of the major divisions",
"Reading the setting from a slide rule is very much like reading",
"measurements from a ruler Imagine that the divisions between 2 and 3 on",
"the D scale figure 2) are those of a ruler divided into tenths of a",
"foot and each tenth of a foot divided in 5 parts 0.02 of a foot long",
"Then the distance from one on the left-hand end of the D scale not",
"shown in figure 2) to one on the left-hand end of the C scale would he",
"2.12 feet Of course a foot rule is divided into parts of uniform",
"length while those on a slide rule get smaller toward the right-hand",
"end but this example may help to give an idea of the method of making",
"and reading settings Now consider another example",
"Example 3a:  2.12 * 7.35 = 15.6",
"If we set the left-hand index of the C scale over 2.12 as in the last",
"example we find that 7.35 on the C scale falls out beyond the body of",
"the rule In a case like this simply use the right-hand index of the C",
"scale If we set this over 2.12 on the D scale and move the runner to",
"7.35 on the C scale we read the result 15.6 on the D scale under the",
"hair-line",
"Now the question immediately arises why did we call the result 15.6",
"and not 1.56? The answer is that the slide rule takes no account of",
"decimal points Thus the settings would be identical for all of the",
"following products:",
"Example 3:",
"a:    2.12    *   7.35   =    15.6",
"b:   21.2     *   7.35   =   156.0",
"c:  212       *  73.5    = 15600.",
"d:    2.12    *    .0735 =      .156",
"e:     .00212 * 735      =      .0156",
"The most convenient way to locate the decimal point is to make a mental",
"multiplication using only the first digits in the given factors Then",
"place the decimal point in the slide rule result so that its value is",
"nearest that of the mental multiplication Thus in example 3a above we",
"can multiply 2 by 7 in our heads and see immediately that the decimal",
"point must be placed in the slide rule result 156 so that it becomes",
"15.6 which is nearest to 14. In example 3b (20 * 7 = 140), so we must",
"place the decimal point to give 156. The reader can readily verify the",
"other examples in the same way",
"Since the product of a number by a second number is the same as the",
"product of the second by the first it makes no difference which of the",
"two numbers is set first on the slide rule Thus an alternative way of",
"working example 2 would be to set the left-hand index of the C scale",
"over 3.16 on the D scale and move the runner to 2.12 on the C scale and",
"read the answer under the hair-line on the D scale",
"The A and B scales are made up of two identical halves each of which is",
"very similar to the C and D scales Multiplication can also be carried",
"out on either half of the A and B scales exactly as it is done on the C",
"and D scales However since the A and B scales are only half as long as",
"the C and D scales the accuracy is not as good It is sometimes",
"convenient to multiply on the A and B scales in more complicated",
"problems as we shall see later on",
"A group of examples follow which cover all the possible combination of",
"settings which can arise in the multiplication of two numbers Example",
"4:   20 * 3 = 60",
"5:   85 * 2 = 170",
"6:   45 * 35 = 1575",
"7:   151 * 42 = 6342",
"8:   6.5 * 15 = 97.5",
"9:   .34 * .08 = .0272",
"10:  75 * 26 = 1950",
"11:  .00054 * 1.4 = .000756",
"12:  11.1 * 2.7 = 29.97",
"13:  1.01 * 54 = 54.5",
"14:  3.14 * 25 = 78.5 DIVISION",
"Since multiplication and division are inverse processes division on a",
"slide rule is done by making the same settings as for multiplication",
"but in reverse order Suppose we have the example:",
"Example 15: (6.70 / 2.12) = 3.16",
"Set indicator over the dividend 6.70 on the D scale Move the slider",
"until the divisor 2.12 on the C scale is under the hair-line Then read",
"the result on the D scale under the left-hand index of the C scale As",
"in multiplication the decimal point must be placed by a separate",
"process Make all the digits except the first in both dividend and",
"divisor equal zero and mentally divide the resulting numbers Place the",
"decimal point in the slide rule result so that it is nearest to the",
"mental result In example 15, we mentally divide 6 by 2. Then we place",
"the decimal point in the slide rule result 316 so that it is 3.16 which",
"is nearest to 3.",
"A group of examples for practice in division follow: Example",
"16:   34 / 2 = 17",
"17:   49 / 7 = 7",
"18:  132 / 12 = 11",
"19:  480 / 16 = 30",
"20: 1.05 / 35 = .03",
"21: 4.32 / 12 = .36",
"22: 5.23 / 6.15 = .85",
"23: 17.1 / 4.5 = 3.8",
"24: 1895 / 6.06 = 313",
"25:   45 /.017 = 2647",
"THE CI SCALE",
"If we divide one (1) by any number the answer is called the reciprocal",
"of the number Thus one-half is the reciprocal of two one-quarter is",
"the reciprocal of four If we take any number say 14, and multiply it",
"by the reciprocal of another number say 2, we get:",
"Example 26: 14 * (1/2) = 7",
"which is the same as 14 divided by two This process can be carried out",
"directly on the slide rule by use of the CI scale Numbers on the CI",
"scale are reciprocals of those on the C scale Thus we see that 2 on the",
"CI scale comes directly over 0.5 or 1/2 on the C scale Similarly 4 on",
"the CI scale comes over 0.25 or 1/4 on the C scale and so on To do",
"example 26 by use of the CI scale proceed exactly as if you were going",
"to multiply in the usual manner except that you use the CI scale instead",
"of the C scale First set the left-hand index of the C scale over 14 on",
"the D scale Then move the indicator to 2 on the CI scale Read the",
"result 7, on the D scale under the hair-line This is really another",
"way of dividing THE READER IS ADVISED TO WORK EXAMPLES 16 TO 25 OVER",
"AGAIN BY USE OF THE CI SCALE",
"SQUARING AND SQUARE ROOT",
"If we take a number and multiply it by itself we call the result the",
"square of the number The process is called squaring the number If we",
"find the number which when multiplied by itself is equal to a given",
"number the former number is called the square root of the given number",
"The process is called extracting the square root of the number Both",
"these processes may be carried out on the A and D scales of a slide",
"rule For example:",
"Example 27: 4 * 4 = square( 4 ) = 16",
"Set indicator over 4 on D scale Read 16 on A scale under hair-line",
"Example 28: square( 25.4 )  = 646.0",
"The decimal point must be placed by mental survey We know that ",
"square( 25.4 ) must be a little larger than square( 25 ) = 625 so that ",
"it must be 646.0.",
"To extract a square root we set the indicator over the number on the A",
"scale and read the result under the hair-line on the D scale When we",
"examine the A scale we see that there are two places where any given",
"number may be set so we must have some way of deciding in a given case",
"which half of the A scale to use The rule is as follows:",
"a If the number is greater than one For an odd number of digits to",
"the left of the decimal point use the left-hand half of the A scale",
"For an even number of digits to the left of the decimal point use the",
"right-hand half of the A scale",
"b If the number is less than one For an odd number of zeros to the",
"right of the decimal point before the first digit not a zero use the",
"left-hand half of the A scale For none or any even number of zeros to",
"the right of the decimal point before the first digit not a zero use",
"the right-hand half of the A scale",
"Example 29: square_root( 157 ) = 12.5",
"Since we have an odd number of digits set indicator over 157 on",
"left-hand half of A scale Read 12.5 on the D scale under hair-line To",
"check the decimal point think of the perfect square nearest to 157. It",
"is 12 * 12 = 144, so that square_root(157) must be a little more than 12 or",
"12.5.",
"Example 30: square_root( .0037 ) = .0608",
"In this number we have an even number of zeros to the right of the",
"decimal point so we must set the indicator over 37 on the right-hand",
"half of the A scale Read 608 under the hair-line on D scale To place",
